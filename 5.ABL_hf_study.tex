\section{Chapter introduction}

Considering its impacts on the energy budget at the surface, the effects of irrigation follow a marked diurnal cycle, with distinct effects in nighttime and daytime and varying amplitude depending on insolation. Average monthly studies (like the works presented in Chapter \ref{chap:monthly}) cannot allow a detailed analysis of these impacts, and simulation outputs at a finer temporal resolution must be used.

%This chapter studies the impacts of irrigation, and particularly of the heterogeneities it creates, on the Atmospheric Boundary Layer. It focuses on analyses at the diurnal scale over the LIAISE field campaign study area. 

%questions scientifiques
\begin{itemize}
    \item Are the effects of simulated irrigation limited to surface variable or do they propagate to the vertical structure of the ABL ?
    \item Are the effects of simulated irrigation on the LIAISE study area purely local or do they affect non-irrigated grid cells ?
    \item Over such a heterogeneous terrain, how representative can ICOLMDOR be ?%todo:unclear
    \item What limits the ICOLMDOR model in its ability to reproduce observations on irrigated and rainfed sites and over the region ?
\end{itemize}
