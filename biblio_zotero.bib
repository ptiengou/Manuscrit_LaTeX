	abstract = {Abstract As an essential source of freshwater river flow comprises {\textasciitilde}80\% of the water consumed in China. Per capita water resources in China are only a quarter of the global average, and its economy is demanding in water resources; this creates an urgent need to quantify the factors that contribute to changes in river flow. Here, we used an offline process-based land surface model (ORCHIDEE) at high spatial resolution (0.1° × 0.1°) to simulate the contributions of climate change, rising atmospheric CO2 concentration, and land-use change to the change in natural river flow for 10 Chinese basins from 1979 to 2015. We found that climate change, especially an increase in precipitation, was responsible for more than 90\% of the changes in natural river flow, while the direct effect of rising CO2 concentration and land-use change contributes at most 6.3\%. Nevertheless, rising CO2 concentration and land-use change cannot be neglected in most basins as these two factors significantly change transpiration. From 2003 to 2015, the increase in water consumption offset more than 30\% of the increase in natural river flow in northern China, especially in the Yellow River basin ({\textasciitilde}140\%), but it had little effect on observed river flow in southern China. Although the uncertainties of rainfall data and the statistical water consumption data could propagate the uncertainties in simulated river flow, this study could be helpful for water planning and management in China under the context of global warming.},

The errors may come from the model itself (structure and parameterization) but also from the meteorological forcing used. In order to separate the two source of errors, four atmospheric forcing datasets, GSWP3 (Global Soil Wetness Project Phase 3), PGF (Princeton Global meteorological Forcing), CRU-NCEP (Climatic Research Unit-National Center for Environmental Prediction), and WFDEI (WATCH Forcing Data methodology applied to ERA-Interim reanalysis data), were used to drive simulations in China by the land surface model ORCHIDEE-MICT(ORganizing Carbon and Hydrology in Dynamic EcosystEms: aMeliorated Interactions between Carbon and Temperature). Simulated soil moisture was compared with in situ and satellite datasets at different spatial and temporal scales in order to (1) estimate the ability of ORCHIDEE-MICT to represent soil moisture dynamics in China; (2) demonstrate the most suitable forcing dataset for further hydrological studies in Yangtze and Yellow River basins; and (3) understand the discrepancies of simulated soil moisture among simulations. Results showed that ORCHIDEE-MICT can simulate reasonable soil moisture dynamics in China, but the quality varies with forcing data. Simulated soil moisture driven by GSWP3 and WFDEI shows the best performance according to the root mean square error (RMSE) and correlation coefficient, respectively, suggesting that both GSWP3 and WFDEI are good choices for further hydrological studies in the two catchments. The mismatch between simulated and observed soil moisture is mainly explained by the bias of magnitude, suggesting that the parameterization in ORCHIDEE-MICT should be revised for further simulations in China. Underestimated soil moisture in the North China Plain demonstrates possible significant impacts of human activities like irrigation on soil moisture variation, which was not considered in our simulations. Finally, the discrepancies of meteorological variables and simulated soil moisture among the four simulations are analyzed. The result shows that the discrepancy of soil moisture is mainly explained by differences in precipitation frequency and air humidity rather than differences in precipitation amount.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {An irrigation module considering irrigation water source and irrigation method has been incorporated into the ACME Land Model (ALM). Global numerical experiments were conducted to investigate irrigation effects and their sensitivity to irrigation water sources and irrigation methods. All simulations shared the same irrigation soil moisture target constrained by a global census data set of irrigation amounts. Irrigation has large impacts on terrestrial water balances especially in regions with extensive irrigation. Such effects depend on the irrigation water source: surface water-fed irrigation decreases runoff and water table depth, while groundwater-fed irrigation increases water table depth, and increases or decreases runoff depending on the pumping intensity. Irrigation effects also depend significantly on the irrigation method. Flood irrigation applies water in large volumes within short durations, resulting in much larger impacts on runoff and water table depth than drip and sprinkler irrigation. Differentiating the irrigation water source and method is important not only for representing the distinct pathways of how irrigation influences the terrestrial water balances, but also for estimating irrigation water use efficiency. Specifically, groundwater pumping has lower irrigation water use efficiency than irrigation relying on surface water withdrawal only due to enhanced recharge rates. Different irrigation methods also affect water use efficiency, with drip irrigation being the most efficient followed by sprinkler and flood irrigation. Our results highlight the importance of explicitly accounting for irrigation source and irrigation method, which are the least understood and constrained aspects in modeling irrigation water demand, water scarcity, and irrigation effects in Earth System Models.},

Simultaneously, humans intervene in the hydrologic cycle and pump groundwater to sustain, for example, drinking water and food production. Here we use a coupled groundwater-to-atmosphere modeling platform, set up over the European continent, to study the influence of groundwater pumping and irrigation on the net atmospheric moisture import of the continental landmasses, which defines the strength of the continental sink. Water use scenarios are constructed to account for uncertainties of atmospheric feedback during the heatwave year 2003. We find that human water use induces groundwater-to-atmosphere feedback, which potentially weaken the continental sink over arid watersheds in southern Europe. This feedback is linked to groundwater storage, which suggests that atmospheric feedbacks to human water use may contribute to drying of watersheds, thereby raising water resources and socio-economic concerns beyond local sustainability considerations.},

	abstract = {Abstract The representation of groundwater dynamics in land surface models and their roles in global precipitation variations has received attention in recent years. Studies have revealed the overall higher soil moisture but rather diverse precipitation changes after incorporating the groundwater component in climate models. However, groundwater effects on large-scale atmospheric energy transport, the fundamental atmospheric variable regulating Earth’s climate, have not been explored thoroughly. In this study, a pair of idealized experiments corresponding to contrast globally fixed water table depths by AMIP-type simulations in the Community Earth System Model was conducted. In the wet (shallow water table) experiments, an increased meridional surface temperature gradient makes the mean meridional energy transports and Hadley circulation stronger than dry (deep water table) experiments over the tropics. Such energy transport changes are primarily attributed to the dynamic contribution (intensified Hadley circulation). The wet experiments make the simulated world be like an aquaplanet simulation with less land–sea temperature contrast and the enhancement (reduction) of mean meridional circulation (stationary eddies) energy transports. Furthermore, the South Asian monsoon circulation in the wet experiment shows a southward shift in the premonsoon season (April–June) and slight weakening in the mature phase (July and August). This study explores the impacts of the soil conditions caused by various water table depths on global energy transport and has further implications for climate model developments and experiment designs.},

As a dynamic vegetation model, it explicitly represents competitive processes such as light competition, sapling establishment, etc. It can thus be used in simulations for the study of feedbacks between transient climate and vegetation cover changes, but it can also be used with a prescribed vegetation distribution. The whole seasonal phenological cycle is prognostically calculated without any prescribed dates or use of satellite data.

              Past studies have shown that climate simulations have substantial warm and dry biases during the summer in the conterminous United States (CONUS), particularly in the central Great Plains (CGP). These biases have critical implications for the interpretation of climate change projections, but the complex overlap of multiple land-atmosphere feedback processes make them difficult to explain (and therefore correct). Even though surface soil moisture (SM) is often cited as a key control variable in these processes, there are still knowledge gaps about its specific role. Here, we use recently developed remotely sensed SM products to analyse the link between spatial patterns of summertime SM, precipitation and air temperature biases over CONUS in 20 different CMIP5 simulations. We identify three main types of bias combinations: (i) a dry/warm bias over the CGP region, with a significant inter-model correlation between SM and air temperature biases (
              R
               = −0.65), (ii) a wet/cold bias in NW CONUS, and (iii) a dry/cold bias in SW CONUS. Combined with irrigation patterns, these results suggest that land-atmosphere feedbacks over the CGP are not only local but have a regional dimension, and demonstrate the added-value of large-scale SM observations for resolving the full feed-back loop between precipitation and temperature.},

	abstract = {A conceptual model based on the surface energy budget is developed to compute the sensitivity of the climatological mean diurnal amplitude and mean daily surface temperature to the soil thermal inertia. It uses the diurnal amplitude of the net surface radiation, the sensitivity of the turbulent fluxes to the surface temperature and the soil thermal inertia. Its performance is evaluated globally with numerical simulations using the atmospheric and the land surface modules of a state‐of‐the‐art climate model. The only regions where the thermal inertia has a limited impact are the moist regions. In dry areas, together with the stability of the boundary layer it plays a major role. It also has a significant impact at high and midlatitudes especially in winter when the turbulent fluxes are weak. In semiarid regions, the soil moisture exhibits a high day‐to‐day variability strongly correlated to the evaporation and the day‐to‐day variability of the surface temperature is generally explained by the soil moisture via its control on the evaporation. However, the soil moisture via its control on the thermal inertia reduces the impact of the day‐time evaporative cooling by reducing the nocturnal cooling. This newly identified moisture‐related negative feedback can reduce the variability of the surface temperature in semiarid regions by up to a factor of 2. The model also provides a simple framework to understand the role of the thermal properties in the frequent cold bias identified in stratified stable atmospheric situations in the northern midlatitudes.},

To explore the influence of these conditions on the water cycle in a unified framework, we introduce new boundary conditions in the ORCHIDEE LSM, which is coupled to the atmospheric general circulation model LMDZ. We use a zoomed and nudged configuration centered over France to reproduce the observed regional weather. Soil moisture and evapotranspiration increase ranging from free drainage to impermeable bottom, then by prescribing saturation closer and closer to the surface. The corresponding response patterns can be related to both climate regimes and soil texture. When confronted to observations from the SIRTA observatory 25 km south of Paris, which exhibits a shallow water table, the best simulations are the ones with prescribed saturation. The local precipitation, however, is only increased if the new bottom boundary conditions are applied globally. The magnitude of this increase depends on the evaporation and on the relative weight of local versus remote sources of moisture for precipitation between Western and Eastern Europe. This suggests that the summer warm/dry bias of many climate models in this region might be alleviated by including a sufficiently realistic ground water description.},

	abstract = {One of the largest challenges facing environmental science is understanding future changes in the terrestrial water cycle and
the subsequent impact on water resources. It has also been recognized by international organizations such as the World Cli-
mate Research Programme (WCRP) that human activities are playing a key role in modifying the continental water cycle,
and therefore must be accounted for in projections. As high-lighted by the WCRP Grand Challenge on “Water for the Food
Baskets of the World,” this issue is especially critical in bread basket regions where water resources are already limited, such
as the Mediterranean basin. The current representation of anthropization in land surface models (LSMs) and therefore within global climate models (GCMs) is in a relatively nascent stage and urgently needs attention if we are to make accurate future projections of
water resources and modifications to the global water cycle. The understanding of the impact of anthropization and its representation in models have been inhibited due to a lack of consistent and extensive observations. Here we present the plans for a project which will bring to-
gether ground-based and airborne measurements with modeling studies to improve our understanding of key natural and
anthropogenic land processes and the subsequent feedbacks with the Mediterranean boundary layer and basin-scale hydrological cycle. These observations will provide the opportunity for a number of community modeling experiments to move
forward within GEWEX, helping to highlight gaps in our knowledge and identify current model deficiencies within land
surface processes and land/atmosphere interactions.},

Yet how these climatic effects compare to other anthropogenic forcings is largely unknown. Here we provide observational and model evidence that expanding irrigation has dampened historical anthropogenic warming during hot days, with particularly strong effects over South Asia. We show that irrigation expansion can explain the negative correlation between global observed changes in daytime summer temperatures and present-day irrigation extent. While global warming increases the likelihood of hot extremes almost globally, irrigation can regionally cancel or even reverse the effects of all other forcings combined. Around one billion people (0.79–1.29) currently benefit from this dampened increase in hot extremes because irrigation massively expanded throughout the 20\$\$\{\}{\textasciicircum}\{th\}\$\$century. Our results therefore highlight that irrigation substantially reduced human exposure to warming of hot extremes but question whether this benefit will continue towards the future.},

	title = {Revisiting flux-gradient relationships of evapotranspiration, sensible heat and momentum near the ground in complex terrain},
	copyright = {all rights reserved},
	url = {http://dspace.uib.es/xmlui/handle/11201/159760},
	abstract = {[eng] The exchanges of energy and matter between the surface and the atmosphere are main 
drivers of the Climate system and affect the biosphere. Variations of the surface characteristics 
alter these exchange rates and impact the climate at the scale of this variability 
and beyond. The atmospheric boundary layer is the part of the atmosphere where the 
effects of the surface are felt directly on a timescale of less than a day. Such effects are 
most noticeable near the ground where the surface heating or cooling, evaporation or 
condensation and the gusts of wind can be felt by the living beings. 
This thesis focuses on the determination of the turbulent fluxes of momentum, sensible 
heat and latent heat flux near ground by means of accessible-to-all instrumentation, 
by comparing estimates obtained using vertical gradients to the actual values provided 
by expensive eddy-covariance systems. The so-called flux-gradient method is applied, 
which makes use of Monin and Obukhov’s similarity theory (MOST) together with empirical 
stability functions of Businger that adapt the method to a large variety of atmospheric 
conditions. 
These stability functions, first obtained in the early 1970’s, were derived for seemingly 
flat and homogeneous conditions, a primary requirement for MOST application, by relating 
flux measurements and vertical gradients of a variable over few tens of meters 
above the ground. In this work these relationships are inspected for locally flat locations 
but in moderately inhomogeneous complex terrain and using data very close to 
the surface, at 4 m or less, with the aim to determine if the theory holds outside of the 
limits for which it was derived. The evaluation of the error made by using this theory, 
its limits under these circumstances and the conditions in which the theory can be 
improved are explored in this work. Lastly the implementation in two test sites where 
no eddy-covariance system is present is made as a conceptual test of the methodology 
developed. 
Three datasets are used for the evaluation of similarity theory. The first one corresponds 
to a wind-energy experimental campaign in complex terrain (ALEX17 in Navarre) with 
measurements at the flat bottom of a valley limited by two mountain ranges. The second 
one corresponds to a research station at the Campus of the University of the Balearic 
Islands in Majorca (ECUIB), a flat location with a mountain range to the north and a 
bay to the south with frequent sea breeze events. The third dataset corresponds to a 
rainfed site in the Urgell county in Catalonia, Els Plans, in the frame of the international 
LIAISE (Land surface Interactions with the Atmosphere over the Iberian Semi-arid Environment) 
campaign, a large agricultural plain surrounded by topography. The three 
sites have a semi-arid climate, with low soil water contents in summer, the third one 
being much drier than the other two. 
The standard approach for the momentum flux using the original functions derived by 
Businger works well for the three sites in all tested conditions, provided that the value 
of the roughness length z0 is adequately prescribed. This physiographical parameter 
varies with direction in heterogeneous terrain and along the year as vegetation evolves, 
imposing a monthly determination by directions. A test made at the ECUIB station using 
a second measurement of wind at about 0.2 m above the ground allows to obtain good 
results for the momentum flux without having to prescribe z0, although with a slightly 
larger error but still within the limits of tolerability (50\% of relative error). 
The estimates of the sensible heat flux (H) in the daytime with the original Businger 
functions perform equally well, and the presence of a second level of air temperature 
allows to skip the prescription of a temperature roughness length and the use of the 
radiometric land-surface temperature, that has low accuracy. It is also found that the 
use of the Richardson number instead of the Obukhov length as the stability parameter 
within the MOST empirical functions provides estimations of similar quality. A particular 
behaviour is found for soils with good water availability under high solar insolation 
that have large latent heat flux (LE) values. For these particular conditions the stability 
function needs different coefficients as the observed sensible heat fluxes are lower than 
the original estimates. The decision to use a new function is taken when the evaporation 
dominates over the surface heating, a regime that can be characterised with a Bowen 
ratio below 1 (Bo = H/LE {\textless} 1). However, the research at Els Plans indicates that an 
additional required condition is that enough water is available at the upper soil as well. 
The performance of the flux-profile method for the latent heat flux (LE) has been tested 
for the ECUIB and Els Plans sites. It is found that the traditional hypothesis that the 
stability functions for temperature and humidity are equal only holds when evaporation 
prevails over surface heating. In the case of dry surfaces with strong heating and little 
evaporation the ratio between the turbulent diffusivities of heat and moisture (the Lewis 
number) increases to 2.5. The intermediate regime, with comparable importance of H 
and LE, has a Lewis number close to 5/3. New stability functions are proposed for these 
two regimes that manage to produce LE estimates within the 50\% tolerable error. 
The set of stability functions considered optimal for semi-arid climates has been tested in 
two sites in the foothills of the Tramuntana mountain range in Majorca, where measurements 
of wind at one height and temperature and humidity at two levels were available, 
together with soil information, but without an eddy-covariance system for verification. 
The procedure tested relies on the Bowen ratio and soil volumetric water content and 
provides meaningful values of the turbulent fluxes, although further refinement of the 
selection criteria is still needed. 
This thesis intends to be a full assessment of the similarity theory applied very near 
the ground in moderately inhomogeneous complex terrain, using gradients provided by 
two levels of actual measurements, with positive conclusions. Such configuration would 
be easy to implement in most operational weather stations, as only an additional second 
level of conventional measurements would be needed. Furthermore a soil moisture 
sensor would allow to select which form of the stability function to apply. With this 
instrumental display, more realistic estimates of LE would be obtained than using approaches 
such as Penman-Monteith, that assume saturated surfaces and over-estimate 
evaporation, a critical issue for agriculture in semi-arid climates.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Evaluating land surface models (LSMs) using available observations is important to understand the potential and limitations of current Earth system models in simulating water- and carbon-related variables. To reveal the error sources of a land surface model (LSM), four essential climate variables have been evaluated in this paper (i.e., surface soil moisture, evapotranspiration, leaf area index, and surface albedo) via simulations with IPSL LSM ORCHIDEE (Organizing Carbon and Hydrology in Dynamic Ecosystems), particularly focusing on the difference between (i) forced simulations with atmospheric forcing data (WATCH-Forcing-DATA-ERA-Interim: WFDEI) and (ii) coupled simulations with the IPSL atmospheric general circulation model. Results from statistical evaluation using satellite- and ground-based reference data show that ORCHIDEE is well equipped to represent spatiotemporal patterns of all variables in general. However, further analysis against various landscape/meteorological factors (e.g., plant functional type, slope, precipitation, and irrigation) suggests potential uncertainty relating to freezing/snowmelt, temperate plant phenology, irrigation, as well as contrasted responses between forced and coupled mode simulations. The biases in the simulated variables are amplified in coupled mode via surface–atmosphere interactions, indicating a strong link between irrigation–precipitation and a relatively complex link between precipitation–evapotranspiration that reflects the hydrometeorological regime of the region (energy-limited or water-limited) and snow-albedo feedback in mountainous and boreal regions. The different results between forced and coupled modes imply the importance of model evaluation under both modes to isolate potential sources of uncertainty in the model.},

	abstract = {To produce food for a growing world population, irrigated areas have increased from approximately 0.63 million km2 of land in 1900 to 3.1 million km2 of land in 2005. Despite this massive expansion, irrigation is still overlooked in most state-of-the-art Earth system models (ESMs) involved in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6). To our knowledge, only three CMIP6 models represent irrigation activities: CESM2, GISS-E2-1-G, and NorESM2-LM. Here, we investigate the role of irrigation on historical climate at global and regional scales by analyzing trends of key surface climate variables in CMIP6 simulations during 1900–2014. The three models including irrigation show distinct behavior from the 15 models without irrigation over intensively irrigated areas (i.e., {\textgreater}50\% of grid cell area is equipped by irrigation): both annual (months that correspond to monthly air temperature higher than 274 K) mean latent heat flux (LHF) and soil moisture increase over time, in contrast to the models without irrigation that show no trend or even a negative trend. The positive LHF trend over intensively irrigated areas in the irrigation-on models is consistent with three satellite-based LHF products. While annual (considering the warmest month in a year) warming trends are found in these regions for most of the no-irrigation models, the increase in LHF induces a cooling trend for the models with irrigation, which was not confirmed by observational air temperature data sets. These findings, supported by satellite data, indicate the importance of improved representation of land management in the next generation of ESM.},

The Laboratoire de Meteorologie Dynamique-Zoom model is run in a 1-D conﬁguration on the fourth Global Energy and Water Cycle Exchanges Project Atmospheric Boundary Layers Study case. Simulations are analyzed and compared to observations, giving insights into the sensitivity of one model that participates to the intercomparison exercise. Snow albedo and thermal inertia are calibrated leading to better surface temperatures. Using the so-called “thermal plume model” improves the momentum mixing in the diurnal ABL. In stable conditions, four turbulence schemes are tested. Best simulations are those in which the turbulence cuts oﬀ above 35 m in the middle of the night, highlighting the contribution of the longwave radiation in the ABL heat budget. However, the nocturnal surface layer is not stable enough to distinguish between surface ﬂuxes computed with diﬀerent stability functions. The absence of subsidence in the forcings and an underestimation of downward longwave radiation are identiﬁed to be likely responsible for a cold bias in the nocturnal ABL. Apart from model-speciﬁc improvements, the paper clariﬁes on which are the critical aspects to improve in general circulation models to correctly represent the summertime ABL over the Antarctic Plateau.},

	abstract = {Roughness height for heat transfer is a crucial parameter in estimation of heat transfer between the land surface and the atmosphere. Although many empirical formulations have been proposed over the past few decades, the uncertainties associated with these formulations are shown to be large, especially over sparse canopies. In this contribution, a simple physically based model is derived for the estimation of the roughness height for heat transfer. This model is derived from a complex physical model based on the ‘‘localized near-ﬁeld’’ Lagrangian theory. This model (called Massman’s model) and another recently proposed model derived by ﬁtting simulation results of a simple multisource bulk transfer model (termed Blu¨mel’s model) are evaluated using three experimental datasets. The results of the model performances are judged by using the derived roughness values to compute sensible heat ﬂuxes with the bulk transfer formulation and comparing these computed ﬂuxes to the observed sensible heat ﬂuxes. It is concluded, on the basis of comparison of calculated versus observed sensible heat ﬂuxes, that both the current model and Blu¨mel’s model provide reliable estimates of the roughness heights for heat transfer. The current model is further shown to be able to explain the diurnal variation in the roughness height for heat transfer. On the basis of a sensitivity analysis, it is suggested that, although demanding, most of the information needed for both models is amendable by satellite remote sensing such that their global incorporation into large-scale atmospheric models for both numerical weather prediction and climate research merits further investigation.},

              Land-use and land-cover changes (land use) alter climates biogeophysically by affecting surface fluxes of energy and water. Yet, near-surface temperature responses to land use across observational versus model-based studies and spatial-temporal scales can be inconsistent.

              LU
              ) using regularized optimal fingerprinting for detection and attribution. We use observations from the Climatic Research Unit and Berkeley Earth alongside historical simulations with and without land use from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 to reconstruct an experiment representing the effects of land use on climate, LU. To assess the signal of land use at spatially resolved continental and global scales, we aggregate all input data across reference regions and continents, respectively. At both scales, land use does not comprise a significantly detectable set of forcings for two of four Earth system models and their multi-model mean. Furthermore, using a principal component analysis, we find that tLU is mostly composed of the non-local effects of land use rather than its local effects. These findings show that, at scales relevant for climate attribution, uncertainties in Earth system model representations of land use are too high relative to the effects of internal variability to confidently assess land use.},

	abstract = {To meet the growing demand for food, land is being managed to be more productive using agricultural intensification practices, such as the use of irrigation. Understanding the specific environmental impacts of irrigation is a critical part of using it as a sustainable way to provide food security. However, our knowledge of irrigation effects on climate is still limited to daytime effects. This is a critical issue to define the effects of irrigation on warming related to greenhouse gases (GHGs). This study shows that irrigation led to an increasing temperature (0.002 °C year−1) by enhancing nighttime warming (0.009 °C year−1) more than daytime cooling (−0.007 °C year−1) during the dry season from 1961–2004 over the North China Plain (NCP), which is one of largest irrigated areas in the world. By implementing irrigation processes in regional climate model simulations, the consistent warming effect of irrigation on nighttime temperatures over the NCP was shown to match observations. The intensive nocturnal warming is attributed to energy storage in the wetter soil during the daytime, which contributed to the nighttime surface warming. Our results suggest that irrigation could locally amplify the warming related to GHGs, and this effect should be taken into account in future climate change projections.},

	abstract = {We analyzed the influence of hillslope flow on projections of climate change by comparing two transient climate simulations with the IPSL climate model between 1980 and 2100. Hillslope flow induces a reorganization and increment of soil moisture (+10\%), which increases evapotranspiration (+4\%) and precipitation (+1\%) and decreases total runoff (−3\%) and air temperature (−0.1 °C) on an annual average over land for 1980–2010 when compared to simulation not representing hillslope flow. These changes in land/atmosphere fluxes are not homogenous and depend on regional climate and surface conditions. Hillslope flow also influences climate change projections. On average over land, it amplifies the positive trend of soil moisture (+23\%), evapotranspiration (+50\%), and precipitation (+7\%) and slightly attenuates global warming (−1\%), especially for daily maximum air temperature. The role of hillslope flow in supporting surface/atmosphere fluxes is more evident at a regional scale. Where precipitation is projected to decrease, hillslope flow is shown to attenuate the related declines in evapotranspiration, precipitation, and total runoff, regardless of aridity conditions and mean air temperature. Where precipitation is projected to increase, hillslope flow amplifies evapotranspiration enhancement but attenuates the increase in precipitation and total runoff. Warming is generally attenuated, especially in semiarid and cold areas, and humid and warm/temperate regions, but the signal is weak. These results demonstrate the role of hillslope flow in enhancing water and energy fluxes between the surface and the atmosphere. They also suggest that including hillslope flow in climate models would weaken the projected intensification of hydrological extreme events.},

	abstract = {Abstract Between 1979 and 2021, global ocean regions experienced a decrease in dry season precipitation, while the trend over land areas varied considerably. Some regions, such as southeastern China, the Maritime Continent, eastern Europe, and eastern North America, showed a slight increasing trend in dry season precipitation. This study analyzes the potential mechanisms behind this trend by using the fifth major global reanalysis produced by ECMWF (ERA5) data. The analysis shows that the weakening of downward atmospheric motions played a critical role in enhancing dry season precipitation over land. An atmospheric moisture budget analysis revealed that larger convergent moisture fluxes lead to an increase in water vapor content below 400 hPa. This, in turn, induced an unstable tendency in the moist static energy profile, leading to a more unstable atmosphere and weakening downward motions, which drove the trend toward increasing dry season precipitation over land. More water vapor in the low troposphere is because of higher moisture convergence and moisture transport from ocean to land regions. In summary, this study demonstrates the intricate elements involved in altering dry season rainfall trends over land, which also emphasizes the importance of comprehending the spatial distribution of the wet-get-wetter and dry-get-drier paradigm. Significance Statement This study found that global land precipitation during the dry season slightly increased from 1979 to 2021, while precipitation over oceans declined. Moist static energy analysis showed a trend toward less stability in areas with increased dry season precipitation and the opposite trend in regions with declining precipitation. Water vapor content trends and dynamic components were the primary controlling mechanism for precipitation trends. Furthermore, the hotspots with pronounced increases or decreases in dry season precipitation reflect local circulation changes influenced by anthropogenic or natural factors.},

On the one hand, studies using global coarse-resolution climate models have found strong positive feedback. However, such models cannot represent convection explicitly. On the other hand, studies using km-scale regional climate models and explicit convection have reported negative feedback. Yet, the large-scale circulation is prescribed in such models. This study revisits the soil moisture–precipitation feedback using global, coupled simulations conducted for 1 y with explicit convection and compares the results to coarse-resolution simulations with parameterized convection. We find significant differences in a majority of points with feedback that is weaker and dominantly negative with explicit convection. The model with explicit convection is more often in a wet regime and prefers the triggering of convection over dry soil in the presence of soil moisture heterogeneity, in contrast to the coarse-resolution model. Further analysis indicates that the feedback not only between soil moisture and evapotranspiration but also between evapotranspiration and precipitation is weaker, in better agreement with observations. Our findings suggest that coarse-resolution models may not be well suited to study aspects of climate change over land such as changes in droughts and heatwaves.},

	abstract = {Irrigation activities are important for sustaining food production and account for 70 \% of total global water withdrawals. In addition, due to increased evapotranspiration (ET) and changes in the leaf area index (LAI), these activities have an impact on hydrology and climate. In this paper, we present a new irrigation scheme within the land surface model ORCHIDEE (ORganising Carbon and Hydrology in Dynamic EcosystEms)). It restrains actual irrigation according to available freshwater by including a simple environmental limit and using allocation rules that depend on local infrastructure. We perform a simple sensitivity analysis and parameter tuning to set the parameter values and match the observed irrigation amounts against reported values, assuming uniform parameter values over land. Our scheme matches irrigation withdrawals amounts at global scale, but we identify some areas in India, China, and the USA (some of the most intensively irrigated regions worldwide), where irrigation is underestimated. In all irrigated areas, the scheme reduces the negative bias of ET. It also exacerbates the positive bias of the leaf area index (LAI), except for the very intensively irrigated areas, where irrigation reduces a negative LAI bias. The increase in the ET decreases river discharge values, in some cases significantly, although this does not necessarily lead to a better representation of discharge dynamics. Irrigation, however, does not have a large impact on the simulated total water storage anomalies (TWSAs) and its trends. This may be partly explained by the absence of nonrenewable groundwater use, and its inclusion could increase irrigation estimates in arid and semiarid regions by increasing the supply. Correlation of irrigation biases with landscape descriptors suggests that the inclusion of irrigated rice and dam management could improve the irrigation estimates as well. Regardless of this complexity, our results show that the new irrigation scheme helps simulate acceptable land surface conditions and fluxes in irrigated areas, which is important to explore the joint evolution of climate, water resources, and irrigation activities.},

Accurately quantifying this coupling enhances the ability to predict hydroclimatic extremes like floods and droughts. In this study, the ability of soil moisture to affect precipitation (SM-P) is characterized by two parts: the influence of soil moisture on evapotranspiration (SM-ET), and the influence of evapotranspiration on precipitation (ET-P). We determined localized ET-P by incorporating the coupling between latent heat flux (LH) and LCL height, to optimize the estimation of the SM-P. This approach links SM more closely to P by considering the influence of surface fluxes. The results indicate that CMIP6 models exhibited the anticipated hotspot patterns for the three coupling metrics in transition regions. However, we observed that climate models generally exhibit weaker SM-P coupling compared to reanalysis models. Both SM-ET and SM-P showcase higher values wherein wet climate regions during dry years, and the converse occurs in dry regions. Due to sensitivity to climate change, the ET-P exhibits a more pronounced upward trend in the future. This study helps understand P’s response to SM shifts in climate models, crucial for predicting hydrological extremes and coupled global warming impact.},

We show that important discrepancies at large-scales exist between global and regional projections. The RCMs project at the end of the 21st century over a large area of Europe a summer warming 1.5–2 K colder, and a much smaller decrease of precipitation of 5\%, versus 20\% in their driving GCMs. The RCMs generally simulate a much smaller increase in shortwave radiation at surface, which directly impacts surface temperature. In addition to differences in cloud cover changes, the absence of timevarying anthropogenic aerosols in most regional simulations plays a major role in the differences of solar radiation changes. We confirm this result with twin regional simulations with and without time-varying anthropogenic aerosols. Additionally, the RCMs simulate larger increases in evapotranspiration over the Mediterranean sea and larger increases/smaller decreases over land, which contribute to smaller changes in relative humidity, with likely impacts on clouds and precipitation changes. Several potential causes of these differences in evapotranspiration changes are discussed. Overall, this work suggests that the current EURO-CORDEX RCM ensemble does not capture the upper part of the climate change uncertainty range, with important implications for impact studies and the adaptation policies that they inform.},

This study presents a revision of the RRS of the ORCHIDEE model that aims to benefit from the high-resolution topography provided by the Hydrological data and maps based on SHuttle Elevation Derivatives at multiple Scales (HydroSHEDS), which is processed to a resolution of approximately 1\&thinsp;km. Adapting a new algorithm to construct river networks, the new RRS in ORCHIDEE allows for the preservation of as much of the hydrological information from HydroSHEDS as the user requires. The evaluation focuses on 12 rivers of contrasting size and climate which contribute freshwater to the Mediterranean Sea. First, the numerical aspect of the new RRS is investigated, in order to identify the practical configuration offering the best trade-off between computational cost and simulation quality for ensuing validations. Second, the performance of the new scheme is evaluated against observations at both monthly and daily timescales. The new RRS satisfactorily captures the seasonal variability of river discharge, although important biases stem from the water budget simulated by the ORCHIDEE model. The results highlight that realistic streamflow simulations require accurate precipitation forcing data and a precise river catchment description over a wide range of scales, as permitted by the new RRS. Detailed analyses at the daily timescale show the promising performance of this high-resolution RRS with respect to replicating river flow variation at various frequencies. Furthermore, this RRS may also eventually be well adapted for further developments in the ORCHIDEE land surface model to assess anthropogenic impacts on river processes (e.g. damming for irrigation operation).},

We then recommend a number of priority research areas for the coming {\textasciitilde}6 years (i.e. until {\textasciitilde}2030), a timescale that matches a number of newly starting international modelling activities and encompasses the IPCC 7th Assessment Report (AR7) and the 2nd UNFCCC Global Stocktake. Progress in these areas will significantly advance our understanding of Earth system change and its impacts and increase the quality and utility of science support to climate policy.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}We emphasize the need for continued improvement in our understanding of, and ability to simulate, the coupled Earth system and the impacts of Earth system change. There is an urgent need to investigate plausible pathways and emission scenarios that realize the Paris Climate Targets, including pathways that overshoot the 1.5 \&deg;C and 2 \&deg;C targets, before later returning to them. Earth System models (ESMs) need to be capable of thoroughly assessing such warming overshoots, in particular, the efficacy of negative CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ emission actions in reducing atmospheric CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ and driving global cooling. An improved assessment of the long-term consequences of stabilizing climate at 1.5 \&deg;C or 2 \&deg;C above pre-industrial temperatures is also required. We recommend ESMs run overshoot scenarios in CO$_{\textrm{2}}$-emission mode, to more fully represent coupled climate - carbon cycle feedbacks. Regional downscaling and impact models should also use forcing data from these simulations, so impact and regional climate projections are as realistic as possible. An accurate simulation of the observed record remains a key requirement of models, as does accurate simulation of key metrics, such as the Effective Climate Sensitivity. For adaptation, improved guidance on potential changes in climate extremes and the modes of variability these extremes develop in, is a key demand. Such improvements will most likely be realized through a combination of increased model resolution and improvement of key parameterizations. We propose a deeper collaboration across modelling efforts targeting increased process realism and coupling, enhanced model resolution, parameterization improvement, and data-driven Machine Learning methods.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}With respect to sampling future uncertainty, increased collaboration between approaches that emphasize large model ensembles and those focussed on statistical emulation is required. We recommend increased attention is paid to High Impact Low Likelihood (HILL) outcomes. In particular, the risk and consequences of exceeding critical tipping points during a warming overshoot. For a comprehensive assessment of the impacts of Earth system change, including impacts arising directly from specific mitigation actions, it is important detailed, disaggregated information from the Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) used to generate future scenarios is available to impact models. Conversely, methods need to be developed to incorporate potential future societal responses to the impacts of Earth system change into scenario development.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Finally, the new models, simulations, data, and scientific advances, proposed in this article will not be possible without long-term development and maintenance of a robust, globally connected infrastructure ecosystem.

	abstract = {Irrigation in semi-arid regions induces thermal heterogeneity across a range of spatial scales that impacts the partitioning of energy at the surface, the development of the atmospheric boundary layer, and the bidirectional interactions between the atmosphere and the surface. In this analysis, we use data from the Land Surface Interactions with the Atmosphere in the Iberian Semi-Arid Environment (LIAISE) experiment combined with a coupled land–atmosphere model to understand the role of the scales of irrigation-induced, thermal heterogeneity on the surface fluxes and consequently, the development of the diurnal convective boundary layer. The surface heterogeneity is characterized by Bowen ratios that range from ∼0.01 in the irrigated areas to ∼30 in the non-irrigated areas; however, the observed boundary-layers dynamics in both locations are similar. In this analysis, we address the questions of how the surface fluxes impact the development of the boundary-layer dynamics and how the boundary layer influences the diurnal cycle of surface fluxes. To interpret the observations, we introduce a heterogeneity scaling scheme where length scales range from local scale (∼100 m) to regional scale (∼10 km) to investigate the role of scale on surface representation in numerical models and to address the discrepancy between surface observations and their representation in weather and climate models. We find that at the surface, both the available energy and its partitioning depend on spatial scale. The observed boundary-layer properties can be explained through the composite of surface fluxes at the regional scale. Surface fluxes at the local scales are unable to replicate the observed boundary layer — even when including large-scale contributions. We find that non-local boundary layer processes like advection are important for partitioning energy at the local scale. We explore the connection between surface fluxes and the development of the boundary layer and the potential non-local effects on boundary-layer development.},

	abstract = {The land surface is characterized by pronounced spatial heterogeneity that spans a wide range of scales. This heterogeneity affects the surface energy and water budgets, as well as the land-atmosphere exchanges of momentum, heat, water and other constituents, through a number of highly nonlinear processes. The resolution of present-day Earth (or climate) system models is still too coarse to explicitly capture the effects of surface heterogeneity, which therefore needs to be parameterized within the framework of complex and nonlinear land surface process schemes. The effects of surface heterogeneity are here grouped in two categories, which we define as “aggregation” and “dynamical” effects. Models of aggregation effects attempt to calculate the contribution of different subgrid scale surface types to the grid box average energy and water budgets and surface-atmosphere exchanges. Such models have been based on discrete approaches, whereby heterogeneity is described in terms of a finite number of subgrid “tiles” or “patches,” and on continuous approaches, in which heterogeneity is described in terms of probability density functions. Subgrid scale aggregation has been shown to especially affect the surface latent and sensible heat fluxes, the simulation of snow, and the dynamics of soil moisture and runoff. Dynamical heterogeneity effects are associated with microscale and mesoscale circulations induced by heterogeneous surfaces. These circulations can influence boundary layer structure, cloud formation, precipitation, and vertical transfer of momentum, energy, and water up to the midtroposphere. In the last decade or so, the importance of land surface heterogeneity representation has been increasingly recognized in a large number of new studies. This paper reviews and critically discusses different approaches that have been proposed to represent aggregation and dynamical effects of surface heterogeneity and their incorporation in land surface process schemes. Some of the methodologies discussed in this paper are of general nature and therefore can be of interest for problems of subgrid scale process description in other geophysical disciplines.},

The difficulty is that numerical models imply spatial averaging over each grid area. Existing formulations am based on the relationship between local fluxes and local gradients and appear to describe the relationship between the grid-averaged flux and the grid-averaged gradient poorly. For example, area-averaging the bulk aerodynamic relationship reveals additional spatial correlation terms and a complex relationship between the grid-averaged exchange coefficient and the stability based on “model” available” grid-averaged variables. This problem is studied by assuming idealized spatial distributions of the Richardson number over a grid area. Some perspective is provided by consulting observed spatial distributions of the layer Richardson number at the surface. Various contributions to the area-averaged surface flux are studied by employing a small-scale numerical model as a grid box or a larger-scale numerical model. Based on these analyses, a new formulation is proposed for relating the area-averaged flux to the area-averaged gradient. However, this expression cannot be seriously tested with existing observations.},

Direct estimates include the determination of the change of mass of a volume of soil and vegetation that evapotranspirates using lysimeters, or direct measurements of turbulent water vapour fluxes by eddy-covariance systems. Parametrized estimates that make use of the Monin–Obukhov similarity theory use vertical gradient measurements of temperature and moisture at one point, and line or area averages by means of scintillometers operating at high frequency. A relation for the evapotranspiration from well-watered surfaces was initially developed by Penman and later expanded for vegetated surfaces and for heterogeneous croplands. A popular simplified expression was obtained by Priestley and Taylor. The current challenge is to find expressions for the evapotranspiration in non-saturated conditions, which are common in arid and semi-arid climates, and for heterogeneous terrain. In numerical models, the estimated actual evapotranspiration over land is obtained as the result of the explicit representation of the different involved sub-processes taking place in the soil and the canopy, using so-called land-surface models. Usually these mechanisms are described in a simplified manner and rely on a number of adjustable parameters. The improvement of such descriptions relies in the availability of experimental measurements to make the physical models more complete and robust.},

	abstract = {The Land surface Interactions with the Atmosphere over the Iberian Semi-arid Environment (LIAISE) campaign was conducted in July 2021, primarily to investigate the role of irrigation in modulating the boundary-layer evolution in the Catalan region of northeastern Spain. Contrasts in near-surface meteorological parameters and boundary-layer thermodynamic profiles at an irrigated and rainfed (arid) site were established during the morning transition. Evapotranspriation dominated the flux partitioning at the irrigated site (Bowen ratio of 0.07–1.1), whilst sensible heat flux dominated at the rainfed (arid) site (Bowen ratio greater than 10.0). The cumulative evapotranspiration during July 2021 was a factor of 10 greater at the irrigated site than at the rainfed (arid) site. The presence of irrigation was shown to modulate the vertical gradients of turbulence, temperature, and moisture. Irrigation is shown to have a significant effect on the development of the boundary layer, including during the morning transition. The morning transition mean buoyancy flux was 2.8 times smaller at the irrigated site (1.1 m2·{\textbackslash} {\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash}cdotp {\textbackslash}s−2{\textbackslash} {\textasciicircum}-2 {\textbackslash}) compared with the rainfed (arid) site (3.1 m2·{\textbackslash} {\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash}cdotp {\textbackslash}s−2{\textbackslash} {\textasciicircum}-2 {\textbackslash}), with a resultant delay in the near-surface buoyancy-flux crossover time (30–90 min) at the irrigated site.

The colder temperatures at sunrise at the irrigated site are predominantly the result of a colder boundary-layer thermodynamic profile from the previous day. At the end of the morning transition (convective onset), temperature differences between the two sites extend through much of the boundary layer and increase in magnitude. The average screen-level (50-m) temperature difference was −3.6{\textbackslash} -3.6 {\textbackslash} K (−2.4{\textbackslash} -2.4 {\textbackslash} K) colder at the irrigated site relative to the rainfed (arid) site.

The spatial scale of heterogeneity impacts the processes that drive the diurnal variability of evapotranspiration. In this study, we combine data with a conceptual, coupled land–atmosphere model to study the drivers of evapotranspiration across spatial scales of heterogeneity for the Land Interactions with the Atmosphere in the Iberian Semi-arid Environment (LIAISE) field campaign. We use a latent heat tendency equation as a diagnostic tool to quantify the contributions of various surface- and boundary-layer driven processes on surface latent heat flux. We define the following spatial scales based on surface characteristics: regional, landscape, and local. We find that, at the regional and landscape scales ({\textgreater}{\textbackslash} {\textgreater} {\textbackslash}1 km), the feedback mechanisms between the surface fluxes and the resulting boundary-layer dynamics enhance the daily latent heat flux by 64\% to 77\%. Conversely, at the local scale (∼{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}sim {\textbackslash}100 m), surface-driven processes are most important for governing evapotranspiration. At the local scale, we find that the energy stored at the surface enhances evaporation in the late afternoon, which could explain the observed time lag between net radiation and latent heat flux. Furthermore, the combined effects of entrainment at the boundary-layer top and advection of heat and moisture enhance daily latent heat by 27\% at the regional scale to 43\% at the local scale. This analysis also has implications for the land-surface modelling community. It suggests that properly reproducing evapotranspiration to capture the relevant processes depends on capacity of the model to resolve the interaction of scales in surface heterogeneous conditions.},

	abstract = {The severe wintertime precipitation decline projected by global climate models (GCMs) over the Southwestern Mediterranean makes this region a major climate change hotspot. Here, we evaluate the performance of the MIT Regional Climate Model (MRCM) in simulating seasonal and inter-annual regional climatic features over Northwestern Africa and the Iberian Peninsula (NWAIP), and develop and interpret regional climate change projections over the same region under the RCP4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, at a resolution of 12 km, driven by three carefully selected GCMs. MRCM succeeds in correctly capturing the spatio-temporal patterns of precipitation when forced by ERA-Interim reanalysis data. In addition to substantial yearround warming, the MRCM ensemble projects a significant decline in precipitation during winter and spring under continued anthropogenic forcing. Even with significant climate change mitigation, the drying is relatively large, with an average of − 34\% in precipitation over Morocco’s three main watersheds during spring, and − 22\% during winter. Projections for the Iberian Peninsula are less severe, though drying trends are still robust. The consistency of the precipitation projections is discussed in the light of physical mechanisms acting at the regional scale. Being located downwind of a large desert, the region is particularly vulnerable to the changes in circulation projected by global models. The latter will advect dry air from the Sahara, which will suppress precipitation. The local topography also contributes to these trends. Overall, our results elucidate the physical processes responsible for winter and spring drying in the southwestern Mediterranean.},

	abstract = {Irrigation accounts for {\textasciitilde}70\% of global freshwater withdrawals and {\textasciitilde}90\% of consumptive water use, driving myriad Earth system impacts. In this Review, we summarize how irrigation currently impacts key components of the Earth system. Estimates suggest that more than 3.6 million km2 of currently irrigated land, with hot spots in the intensively cultivated US High Plains, California Central Valley, Indo-Gangetic Basin and northern China. Process-based models estimate that {\textasciitilde}2,700 ± 540 km3 irrigation water is withdrawn globally each year, broadly consistent with country-reported values despite these estimates embedding substantial uncertainties. Expansive irrigation has modified surface energy balance and biogeochemical cycling. A shift from sensible to latent heat fluxes, and resulting land–atmosphere feedbacks, generally reduce regional growing season surface temperatures by {\textasciitilde}1–3 °C. Irrigation can ameliorate temperature extremes in some regions, but conversely exacerbates moist heat stress. Modelled precipitation responses are more varied, with some intensive cropping regions exhibiting suppressed local precipitation but enhanced precipitation downstream owing to atmospheric circulation interactions. Additionally, irrigation could enhance cropland carbon uptake; however, it can also contribute to elevated methane fluxes in rice systems and mobilize nitrogen loading to groundwater. Cross-disciplinary, integrative research efforts can help advance understanding of these irrigation–Earth system interactions, and identify and reduce uncertainties, biases and limitations.},

This study is focused on a day when the largest forcing on the boundary layer originated from the land surface/land use. To examine these impacts, we also applied the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model. Results from the observations show that compared to nonirrigated areas, air temperature, wind speed, and PBL height (PBLH) were lower while dewpoint temperature and latent heat flux were higher over irrigated areas. Findings suggest that entrainment layer drying and differences in energy partitioning over irrigated and nonirrigated areas played an important role in PBL evolution. In the final hours of the day, the PBL collapsed faster over nonirrigated areas compared to irrigated. The WRF Model simulations agree with these observations. They also show that the extent of irrigation [expressed as irrigation fraction (IF)] in an area impacts L–A response. Under ∼60\% IF, the latent heat flux and mixing ratio reach their highest value while temperature and PBLH are at their lowest, and sensible heat flux is near its lowest value. Results are reversed for ∼2\% IF. It is concluded that irrigation notably impacts L–A interactions and PBL evolution.},

Using these observations, we examine how irrigation affects diurnal terrain-generated slope circulations, specifically the slope wind. We find that irrigation applied to upslope regions of gently sloping terrain reduces terrain-induced baroclinicity and the associated pressure gradient force by up to two-thirds. This leads to the reduction in the afternoon and evening upslope wind and is supported through comparisons to the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh operational model, which does not explicitly account for irrigation. Additionally, the presence of irrigation decreases daytime sensible heat flux (Bowen ratio reduced 40\% compared to non-irrigated regions), weakening turbulent transport of momentum. Modifications to the terrain-forced circulation by irrigation has the potential to affect moisture transport and thus cloud and precipitation formation over the Great Plains.},

	abstract = {Abstract Extensive expansion in irrigated agriculture has taken place over the last half century. Due to increased irrigation and resultant land-use–land-cover change, the central United States has seen a decrease in temperature and changes in precipitation during the second half of the twentieth century. To investigate the impacts of widespread commencement of irrigation at the beginning of the growing season and continued irrigation throughout the summer on local and regional weather, the Great Plains Irrigation Experiment (GRAINEX) was conducted in the spring and summer of 2018 in southeastern Nebraska. GRAINEX consisted of two 15-day intensive observation periods. Observational platforms from multiple agencies and universities were deployed to investigate the role of irrigation in surface moisture content, heat fluxes, diurnal boundary layer evolution, and local precipitation. This article provides an overview of the data collected and an analysis of the role of irrigation in land–atmosphere interactions on time scales from the seasonal to the diurnal. The analysis shows that a clear irrigation signal was apparent during the peak growing season in mid-July. This paper shows the strong impact of irrigation on surface fluxes, near-surface temperature and humidity, and boundary layer growth and decay.},

This research documents, analyzes, and synthesizes the projected changes in precipitation P, evapotranspiration E, net water supply from the atmosphere to the surface P–E, and surface soil moisture over these regions as simulated by 17 global climate models from the sixth exercise of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) under two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5. It also explores the sensitivity of the results to the chosen climate scenario and model resolution and assesses how the projections have evolved from the fifth exercise (CMIP5). Models project a statistically robust drying over the entire Mediterranean and coastal North Africa. Over the Northern Mediterranean sector, a significant precipitation decrease reaching −0.4 ∓ 0.1 mm day−1{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mathrmday{\textasciicircum}-1 {\textbackslash} is projected during the 21st century under the SSP5-8.5 scenario. Conversely, a significant increase in precipitation of +0.05 to 0.3 ∓ 0.1 mm day−1 is projected over South-Eastern Sahara under the same scenario. Evapotranspiration and soil moisture exhibit decreasing trends over the Mediterranean basin and an increase over the Sahara for both SSPs, with a notable acceleration from the 2020s. As a result, P-E is projected to decrease at a rate of about −0.3 mm day−1 under the high-end scenario SSP5-8.5 over the Mediterranean whilst no significant changes are expected over the Sahara due to evapotranspiration compensation effects. CMIP6 and CMIP5 models project qualitatively similar patterns of changes but CMIP6 models exhibit more intense changes over the Mediterranean basin and South-Eastern Sahara, especially during winter.},

	abstract = {Global water models (GWMs) simulate the terrestrial water cycle on the global scale and are used to assess the impacts of climate change on freshwater systems. GWMs are developed within different modelling frameworks and consider different underlying hydrological processes, leading to varied model structures. Furthermore, the equations used to describe various processes take different forms and are generally accessible only from within the individual model codes. These factors have hindered a holistic and detailed understanding of how different models operate, yet such an understanding is crucial for explaining the results of model evaluation studies, understanding inter-model differences in their simulations, and identifying areas for future model development. This study provides a comprehensive overview of how 16 state-of-the-art GWMs are designed. We analyse water storage compartments, water flows, and human water use sectors included in models that provide simulations for the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project phase 2b (ISIMIP2b). We develop a standard writing style for the model equations to enhance model intercomparison, improvement, and communication. In this study, WaterGAP2 used the highest number of water storage compartments, 11, and CWatM used 10 compartments. Six models used six compartments, while four models (DBH, JULES-W1, Mac-PDM.20, and VIC) used the lowest number, three compartments. WaterGAP2 simulates five human water use sectors, while four models (CLM4.5, CLM5.0, LPJmL, and MPI-HM) simulate only water for the irrigation sector. We conclude that, even though hydrological processes are often based on similar equations for various processes, in the end these equations have been adjusted or models have used different values for specific parameters or specific variables. The similarities and differences found among the models analysed in this study are expected to enable us to reduce the uncertainty in multi-model ensembles, improve existing hydrological processes, and integrate new processes.},

This paper outlines the way that models have evolved through this change of purpose and what might the future hold. It highlights the importance of distinguishing between advances in the science within the modelling components, with the advances of how to represent their interaction. This latter aspect of modelling is often overlooked but will increasingly manifest as an issue as the complexity of the system, the time and space scales of the system being modelled increase.

	abstract = {Land surface models (LSMs) are a vital tool for understanding, projecting, and predicting the dynamics of the land surface and its role within the Earth system, under global change. Driven by the need to address a set of key questions, LSMs have grown in complexity from simpliﬁed representations of land surface biophysics to encompass a broad set of interrelated processes spanning the disciplines of biophysics, biogeochemistry, hydrology, ecosystem ecology, community ecology, human management, and societal impacts. This vast scope and complexity, while warranted by the problems LSMs are designed to solve, has led to enormous challenges in understanding and attributing differences between LSM predictions. Meanwhile, the wide range of spatial scales that govern land surface heterogeneity, and the broad spectrum of timescales in land surface dynamics, create challenges in tractably representing processes in LSMs. We identify three “grand challenges” in the development and use of LSMs, based around these issues: managing process complexity, representing land surface heterogeneity, and understanding parametric dynamics across the broad set of problems asked of LSMs in a changing world. In this review, we discuss progress that has been made, as well as promising directions forward, for each of these challenges. Plain Language Summary Land surface models (LSMs) are the part of climate models that simulate processes happening at the Earth's surface. These include reﬂection of the sunlight, evaporation from ecosystems, and the amount of carbon from human emissions that the land takes up. LSMs also need to simulate how human management of the land surface changes the climate both directly (e.g., via the effect on evaporation) and in the long term (via changing the amount of carbon stored in wood and soil). Not surprisingly, trying to make a single mathematical representation of all of these different parts of the Earth system is difﬁcult. Here we discuss themes that repeatedly affect all teams developing LSMs: how to manage the increasing number of complicated model components, how to represent the high degree of variability of the land surface, and how to predict how the properties of the surface (particularly those of plant communities) will change. These are large problems, with no obvious easy solutions. We hope to spark discussion and investment into their resolution, concomitant with the increasing importance of LSMs as our best tools for translating possible trajectories of climate change into impacts on humans, ecosystems, food and water supplies, and river systems.},

	abstract = {Abstract The response of boundary layer properties and cloudiness to changes in surface evaporative fraction (EF) is investigated in a single-column model to quantify the locally coupled impact of subgrid surface variations on the atmosphere during summer. Sensitive coupling days are defined when the model atmosphere exhibits large variations across a range of EFs centered on the analyzed value. Coupling sensitivity exists as both positive feedback (cloudiness increases with EF) and negative feedback (clouds increase with decreasing EF) regimes. The positive regime manifests in shallow convection situations, which are capped by a strengthened inversion and subsidence, restricting the vertical extent of convection to just above the boundary layer. Surfaces with larger EF (greater surface latent heat flux) can inject more moisture into the vertically confined system, lowering the cloud base and an increasing cloud liquid water path (LWP). Negative feedback regimes tend to manifest when large-scale deep convection, such as from mesoscale convective systems and fronts, is advected through the domain, where convection strengthens over surfaces with a lower EF (greater surface sensible heat flux). The invigoration of these systems by the land surface leads to an increase in LWP through strengthened updrafts and stronger coupling between the boundary layer and the free atmosphere. These results apply in the absence of heterogeneity-induced mesoscale circulations, providing a one-dimensional dynamical perspective on the effect of surface heterogeneity. This study provides a framework of intermediate complexity, lying between parcel theory and high-resolution coupled land–atmosphere modeling, and therefore isolates the relevant first-order processes in land–atmosphere interactions. Significance Statement Cloud formation, distribution, and other properties may be sensitive to heterogeneous surfaces depending on the strength and location of such heterogeneities and the background atmospheric state. This may drive differences in the cloud population depending on which part of the domain one is located. This may also lead to mesoscale circulations, which may strengthen or weaken this effect. Currently, climate models act on scales (∼100 km) that are too large to explicitly represent these processes, which are strongest at smaller scales (around 5–40 km). Therefore, subgrid-scale heterogeneity is neglected, and any predictability and model fidelity it may provide is lost. We use a simple model to diagnose sensitivity of the local atmosphere to surface variations meant to represent possible subgrid heterogeneity, providing a first-order estimate of its effect. We conclude that preferentially sensitive atmospheric states exist that lead to positive and/or negative feedback between land and atmosphere. This information is valuable to future climate model parameterizations aimed at improving the representation of these feedbacks.},

	abstract = {Abstract The heterogeneously heated free convective boundary layer (CBL) is investigated by means of dimensional analysis and results from large-eddy simulations (LES) and direct numerical simulations (DNS). The investigated physical model is a CBL that forms in a linearly stratified atmosphere heated from the surface by square patches with a high surface buoyancy flux. Each simulation has been run long enough to show the formation of a peak in kinetic energy, corresponding to the “optimal” heterogeneity size with strong secondary circulations, and the subsequent transition into a horizontally homogeneous CBL. Scaling laws for the time of the optimal state and transition and for the vertically integrated kinetic energy (KE) have been developed. The laws show that the optimal state and transition do not occur at a fixed ratio of the heterogeneity size to the CBL height. Instead, these occur at a higher ratio for simulations with increasing heterogeneity sizes because of the development of structures in the downward-moving air that grow faster than the CBL thickness. The moment of occurrence of the optimal state and transition are strongly related to the heterogeneity amplitude: stronger amplitudes result in an earlier optimal state and a later transition. Furthermore, a decrease in patch size combined with a compensating increase in patch surface buoyancy flux to maintain the energy input results in decreasing KE and a later transition. The simulations suggest that a CBL with a heterogeneity size smaller than the initial CBL height has less entrainment than a horizontally homogeneous CBL, whereas one with a larger heterogeneity size has more.},

A set of three metrics are used to assess the sensitivity of afternoon rainfall occurrence to morning soil moisture in terms of their spatial, temporal, and heterogeneity characteristics. Positive (negative) spatial feedback indicates that the afternoon rainfall occurs more frequently over wetter (drier) land surface than its surroundings. Positive (negative) temporal feedback indicates preference over temporally wetter (drier) conditions, and positive (negative) heterogeneity feedback indicates preference over more spatially heterogeneous (homogeneous) soil moisture conditions. We confirm previous results highlighting a dominantly positive spatial feedback in the models as opposed to observations. On average, models tend to agree better with observations for temporal and heterogeneity feedback characteristics, although intermodel variability is largest for these metrics. The collective influence of the three feedbacks suggests that they may lead to more localized precipitation persistence in models than in observations.},

To aid in the development of coupled land and atmosphere SGS parameterizations for global models, we present a study of different aspects of highly realistic sub-100 km scale land-surface heterogeneity. The primary experiment is a set of simulations of September 24, 2017 over the Southern Great Plains (SGP) site using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with 100-m horizontal resolution. The overall impact of land-surface heterogeneity is evaluated by comparing cloud and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) production in large-eddy simulations (LESs) using heterogeneous and homogeneous surface fields (namely sensible and latent heat fluxes) specified by an offline field-scale resolving land-surface model (LSM). The heterogeneous land surface leads to significantly more cloud and TKE production. We then isolate specific sources of heterogeneity by using selectively domain-wide averaged fields in the LSM. It is found that heterogeneity in the land surface created by precipitation is effectively responsible for the increases in cloud and TKE production, while rivers and soil type have a negligible impact and land cover has only a small impact. Additional experiments modify the Bowen ratio in the surface fields and the initial wind profile of the heterogeneous case to clarify the results seen. Finally two additional days at the SGP site are simulated showing a similar increase in cloud production in heterogeneous cases.},

	abstract = {Despite some recent improvements, major deficiencies remain in model simulations using parameterised convection in capturing both the phase and amplitude of the daily cycle of precipitation in tropical regions. The difficulties are particularly acute in regions of heterogeneous surface conditions, since the simulations need not only to respond appropriately to the local forcing from surface fluxes but also to capture the interactions with near-surface mesoscale circulations. Here, we examine such a situation by means of idealised cloud-resolving simulations of deep convection over a heterogeneous surface, performed using the cloud-resolving simulation known as the Met Office NERC Cloud model (MONC). In these simulations, we show that precipitation forms preferentially over dry and warm patches (“DRY”) compared with wet and cold patches (“WET”), with the peak precipitation rates differing by a factor of approximately 4. The initiation of precipitation occurs approximately 1.5 hr earlier in the DRY patches compared with the WET patches. Moreover, within the WET and DRY patches there are marked differences in the spatial distribution of the precipitation. These cloud-resolving simulations are then used as a benchmark to assess the behaviour of simulations using parameterised convection, performed using the idealised configuration of the Met Office Unified Model (MetUM). The MetUM simulations produce a response with some qualitative similarities to the cloud-resolving simulations. In particular, although the simulations with parameterised convection initiate precipitation too early, they are capable of capturing the relative amounts of daily-mean precipitation in the DRY and WET patches. We propose that the cloud-resolving simulations could be used further to investigate the impact of fully interactive surface schemes and as benchmark simulations to evaluate new parameterisation schemes.},

	abstract = {Abstract Land–atmosphere (L-A) interactions are a main driver of Earth’s surface water and energy budgets; as such, they modulate near-surface climate, including clouds and precipitation, and can influence the persistence of extremes such as drought. Despite their importance, the representation of L-A interactions in weather and climate models remains poorly constrained, as they involve a complex set of processes that are difficult to observe in nature. In addition, a complete understanding of L-A processes requires interdisciplinary expertise and approaches that transcend traditional research paradigms and communities. To address these issues, the international Global Energy and Water Exchanges project (GEWEX) Global Land–Atmosphere System Study (GLASS) panel has supported “L-A coupling” as one of its core themes for well over a decade. Under this initiative, several successful land surface and global climate modeling projects have identified hot spots of L-A coupling and helped quantify the role of land surface states in weather and climate predictability. GLASS formed the Local Land–Atmosphere Coupling (LoCo) project and working group to examine L-A interactions at the process level, focusing on understanding and quantifying these processes in nature and evaluating them in models. LoCo has produced an array of L-A coupling metrics for different applications and scales and has motivated a growing number of young scientists from around the world. This article provides an overview of the LoCo effort, including metric and model applications, along with scientific and programmatic developments and challenges.},

The vast majority of previous research has focused on the initiation of convection, but in many regions of the world, the majority of rain comes from remotely triggered mesoscale convective systems (MCSs). Here we conduct a systematic observational analysis of soil moisture feedbacks on propagating MCSs anywhere in the world and show a strong positive impact of drier soils on convection within mature MCSs. From thousands of storms captured in satellite imagery over the Sahel, we find that convective cores within MCSs are favored on the downstream side of dry patches 
≥
200 km across. The effect is particularly strong during the afternoon–evening transition when convection reaches its diurnal peak in intensity and frequency, with dry soils accounting for an additional one in five convective cores. Dry soil patterns intensify MCSs through a combination of convergence, increased instability, and wind shear, all factors that strengthen organized convection. These favorable conditions tend to occur in the vicinity of a surface-induced anomalous displacement of the Sahelian dry line/intertropical discontinuity, suggesting a strong link between dry line dynamics and soil moisture state. Our results have important implications for nowcasting of severe weather in the Sahel and potentially in other MCS hotspot regions of the world.},

The probability of transitions from shallow to deep cumulus, and subsequent precipitation onset, increases by 58\% over drier surfaces in weakly stratified environments having deeper boundary layers.

	abstract = {The Earth's land surface features spatial and temporal heterogeneity over a wide range of scales below those resolved by current Earth system models (ESMs). State-of-the-art land and atmosphere models employ parameterizations to represent their subgrid heterogeneity, but the land–atmosphere coupling in ESMs typically operates on the grid scale. Communicating the information on the land surface heterogeneity with the overlying atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) remains a challenge in modeling land–atmosphere interactions. In order to account for the subgrid-scale heterogeneity in land–atmosphere coupling, we implement a new coupling scheme in the Energy Exascale Earth system model version 1 (E3SMv1) that uses adjusted surface variances and covariance of potential temperature and specific water content as the lower boundary condition for the atmosphere model. The new lower boundary condition accounts for both the variability of individual subgrid land surface patches and the inter-patch variability. The E3SMv1 single-column model (SCM) simulations over the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Southern Great Plain (SGP) site were performed to assess the impacts. We find that the new coupling parameterization increases the magnitude and diurnal cycle of the temperature variance and humidity variance in the lower ABL on non-precipitating days. The impacts are primarily attributed to subgrid inter-patch variability rather than the variability of individual patches. These effects extend vertically from the surface to several levels in the lower ABL on clear days. We also find that accounting for surface heterogeneity increases low cloud cover and liquid water path (LWP). These cloud changes are associated with the change in cloud regime indicated by the skewness of the probability density function (PDF) of the subgrid vertical velocity. In precipitating days, the inter-patch variability reduces significantly so that the impact of accounting for surface heterogeneity vanishes. These results highlight the importance of accounting for subgrid heterogeneity in land–atmosphere coupling in next-generation ESMs.},

The surface SHF heterogeneity in the domain is analytically created as a function of the spectral slope in the wavelength range from a few tens of kilometres to a few hundreds of metres in the SHF spectrum on a log–log scale. Assuming surface energy balance and spatially uniform available energy, the prescribed SHF has a phase lag of 180° with respect to the latent heat flux (LHF) in the domain. Two sets of three simulations are forced by heterogeneous surface SHF fields, which are characterized by similar statistics. One set, however, is created with a spectral slope of (where is wave number) and the other with a slope of . All of the simulations are integrated with the same observation-based initial sounding favourable for moist convection. In all of the -slope cases, early non-precipitating shallow clouds further develop into deep thunderstorms. But in all of the -slope cases, only shallow clouds develop. A key process in the transition to deep convection is the formation of a mesoscale pool of cool and moist air just above the top of the CBL. This high relative humidity (RH) pool is formed by repeated deep penetrations of turbulent plumes into the free atmosphere over a mesoscale surface of high SHF. These cross-scale fluxes, the vertical transports of mesoscale moisture and heat fluctuations by turbulent updraughts, are critical for the formation of the mesoscale pool of high RH. However, these cross-scale fluxes are cancelled out in the process of averaging, and thus appear negligible in the vertical profiles of domain-averaged moisture and heat fluxes.},

	abstract = {Abstract Idealized large-eddy simulations (LESs) with prescribed heterogeneous land surface heat fluxes are performed to study the impact of the heterogeneity length scale and background wind speed on the development of shallow cumulus and the subsequent transition to congestus/deep convection. We study the impact of land surface heterogeneity in an atmosphere that favors shallow convection but is also conditionally unstable with respect to deeper convection. We find that before the convection transition, larger and thicker shallow cumulus clouds are attached to moisture pools near the PBL top over patches with low evaporative fraction (referred to as “DRY”). This feature is attributable to a surface-induced secondary circulation whose development depends on the heterogeneity size and the background wind speed. With large patches (≥5 km) under zero ambient wind, the secondary mesoscale circulation promotes the vertical transport of moisture forming a moisture pool over DRY patches, while with smaller patches, no such circulation develops. The influence of the background wind on the secondary circulation is strong such that any wind stronger than 2 m s−1 effectively eliminates the impact of surface heterogeneity on the PBL and brings no secondary circulation. This is because the triggered secondary circulation is not strong enough to withstand the imposed background wind. Based on these, we propose two criteria for the convection transition, namely, that the heterogeneity length scale is greater than 5 km and that the background wind speed is less than Uc0, where Uc0 is the near-surface cross-patch wind speed of the secondary circulation under zero background wind for a given patch size and is about 1.5 m s−1 in our cases.},

During late summer, ShCu occurs over cities the most frequently and over open waters the least frequently, and more often over forest than over grassland. The preferential occurrence of ShCu over forest relative to grassland is consistent with surface measurements showing larger heat fluxes over forests. This preferential occurrence also varies with the length scales of land patches with the largest cloud occurrence difference shifting from smaller length scales ({\textless}9 km) during midday to larger scales ({\textgreater}9 km) in the early afternoon. Consistent with theory, these signals are more pronounced under low wind conditions. The preferential length scale shift with time suggests the existence of secondary circulations that strengthen and promote convergence over larger spatial scales as the differential land surface heating intensifies.},

In this study, we examine the impacts of large-scale advection on the cloud populations and land-atmospheric coupling observed during the Holistic Interactions of Shallow Clouds, Aerosols, and Land-Ecosystems field campaign in 2016. We performed two large eddy simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model for a day in which the transition from clear-sky to shallow precipitating clouds and isolated deep convection was observed. The control simulation reproduced the overall distribution of cloud populations by using realistic soil conditions with an interactive land model. In the sensitivity simulation where large-scale advection is removed, a strong relationship between the land and boundary layer is found. To study the timing, location, and intensity of convective initiation and the relationship of clouds with land surface properties, a cluster analysis of equivalent potential temperature is performed for the simulation without large-scale advection. That analysis shows that convective clouds first form over regions with higher surface sensible heat flux. Precipitation from those convective clouds likely triggers new updrafts nearby about 2 hr later through the lifting associated with cold pools. The cluster analysis also shows that in addition to the spatial pattern of soil moisture, land use and soil texture in western Oklahoma also influence the location of convective initiation.},

	abstract = {This paper expands the one-dimensionally based CTP-HIlow framework for describing atmospheric controls on soil moisture-boundary layer interactions [Findell and Eltahir, 2003] to three dimensions by including low-level wind effects in the analysis. The framework is based on two measures of atmospheric thermodynamic properties: the convective triggering potential (CTP), a measure of the temperature lapse rate between approximately 1 and 3 km above the ground surface, and a low-level humidity index, HIlow. These two measures are used to distinguish between three types of early morning soundings: those favoring rainfall over dry soils, those favoring rainfall over wet soils, and those whose convective potential is unaffected by the partitioning of fluxes at the surface. The focus of this paper is the additional information gained by incorporating information about low-level winds into the CTP-HIlow framework. Three-dimensional simulations using MM5 and an analysis of observations from the FIFE experiment within this framework highlight the importance of the winds in determining the sensitivity of convection to fluxes from the land surface. A very important impact of the 3D winds is the potential for low-level backing or unidirectional winds with great shear to suppress convective potential. Because of this suppression of convection in certain wind conditions, far fewer simulations produced rain than would be anticipated based solely on the 1D framework of understanding. However, when the winds allowed, convection occurred in a manner consistent with the 1D-based expectations. Generally speaking, in the regime where dry soils were expected to have an advantage, convection was triggered over dry soils more often than over wet; in the regime where wet soils were expected to have an advantage, convection was more frequently triggered over wet soils than over dry. Additionally, when rainfall occurred in both simulations with wet soils and simulations with dry soils for a given day, rainfall depths were typically greater in the simulations with wet soils. Similarly, the FIFE data showed numerous days with convective potential but no rainfall: each of these days had low-level backing or strongly shearing winds. Four days with high humidity deficits and veering winds in the lowest 300 mbar did have rain, highlighting the enhanced buoyancy effects of low-level veering winds.},

Generally missing from such studies, however, is an indication of the extent to which the simulated coupling strength is model dependent. Four modeling groups have recently performed a highly controlled numerical experiment that allows an objective intermodel comparison of land–atmosphere coupling strength, focusing on short (weekly down to subhourly) timescales. The experiment essentially consists of an ensemble of 1-month simulations in which each member simulation artificially maintains the same (model specific) time series of surface prognostic variables. Differences in atmospheric behavior between the ensemble members then indicate the degree to which the state of the land surface controls atmospheric processes in that model. A comparison of the four sets of experimental results shows that coupling strength does indeed vary significantly among the AGCMs.},

Here we demonstrate that these strategies err on the side of excess complexity, as the values reported by FAO and outputted by Global Models are largely conditioned by irrigated areas and their uncertainty. Modelling irrigation water withdrawals as a function of irrigated areas yields almost the same results in a much parsimonious way, while permitting the exploration of all model uncertainties.

On the global scale, about 70\% of any imparted signal in the hydrologic cycle is lost in the transition from atmosphere to land, and 70\% of the remaining signal is lost from land to atmosphere. This means that globally, less than 10\% of the signal of any change survives the complete circuit of the hydrologic cycle in this model. Regionally, there is a great deal of variability. Specification of observed precipitation to the land component of the climate model strongly communicates its signal to soil wetness in rainy regions, but predictive skill in evapotranspiration arises primarily in dry regions. A maximum in signal transmission to model precipitation exists in between, peaking where mean rainfall rates are 1.5–2 mm day−1. It appears that the nature of the climate system inherently limits to these regions the potential impact on prediction of improvements in the ability of models to simulate the water cycle. Land initial conditions impart a weaker signal on the system than replacement of precipitation, so a weaker response is realized in the system, focused mainly in dry regions.},

We deployed several aircraft to sample the CO2 concentration and fluxes over the whole area, while fixed stations observed the fluxes and concentrations at high accuracy. Several (mesoscale) meteorological modeling tools were used to plan the experiment and flight patterns. Results show that at regional scale the relation between profiles and fluxes is not obvious, and is strongly influenced by airmass history and mesoscale flow patterns. In particular, we show from an analysis of data for a single day that taking either the concentration at several locations as representative of local fluxes or taking the flux measurements at those sites as representative of larger regions would lead to incorrect conclusions about the distribution of sources and sinks of carbon. Joint consideration of the synoptic and regional flow, fluxes, and land surface is required for a correct interpretation. This calls for an experimental and modeling strategy that takes into account the large spatial gradients in concentrations and the variability in sources and sinks that arise from different land use types. We briefly describe how such an analysis can be performed and evaluate the usefulness of the data for planning of future networks or longer campaigns with reduced experimental efforts.},

The solid and liquid water stored at the land surface has a large influence on the regional climate, its variability and predictability, including effects on the energy, water and carbon cycles. Notably, snow and soil moisture affect surface radiation and flux partitioning properties, moisture storage and land surface memory. They both strongly affect atmospheric conditions, in particular surface air temperature and precipitation, but also large-scale circulation patterns. However, models show divergent responses and representations of these feedbacks as well as systematic biases in the underlying processes. LS3MIP will provide the means to quantify the associated uncertainties and better constrain climate change projections, which is of particular interest for highly vulnerable regions (densely populated areas, agricultural regions, the Arctic, semi-arid and other sensitive terrestrial ecosystems). 

 The experiments are subdivided in two components, the first addressing systematic land biases in offline mode (“LMIP”, building upon the 3rd phase of Global Soil Wetness Project; GSWP3) and the second addressing land feedbacks attributed to soil moisture and snow in an integrated framework (“LFMIP”, building upon the GLACE-CMIP blueprint).},

We implemented a roughness sublayer turbulence parameterization in a multilayer canopy model (CLM-ml v0) to test if this theory provides a tractable parameterization extending from the ground through the canopy and the roughness sublayer. We compared the canopy model with the Community Land Model (CLM4.5) at seven forest, two grassland, and three cropland AmeriFlux sites over a range of canopy heights, leaf area indexes, and climates. CLM4.5 has pronounced biases during summer months at forest sites in midday latent heat flux, sensible heat flux, gross primary production, nighttime friction velocity, and the radiative temperature diurnal range. The new canopy model reduces these biases by introducing new physics. Advances in modeling stomatal conductance and canopy physiology beyond what is in CLM4.5 substantially improve model performance at the forest sites. The signature of the roughness sublayer is most evident in nighttime friction velocity and the diurnal cycle of radiative temperature, but is also seen in sensible heat flux. Within-canopy temperature profiles are markedly different compared with profiles obtained using Monin–Obukhov similarity theory, and the roughness sublayer produces cooler daytime and warmer nighttime temperatures. The herbaceous sites also show model improvements, but the improvements are related less systematically to the roughness sublayer parameterization in these canopies. The multilayer canopy with the roughness sublayer turbulence improves simulations compared with CLM4.5 while also advancing the theoretical basis for surface flux parameterizations.},

We show that substantial performance improvement is possible for empirical models using meteorological data alone, with no explicit vegetation or soil properties, thus setting lower bounds on a priori expectations on LSM performance. The process also identifies key meteorological variables that provide predictive power. We provide an ensemble of empirical benchmarks that are simple to reproduce and provide a range of behaviours and predictive performance, acting as a baseline benchmark set for future studies. We reanalyse previously published LSM simulations and show that there is more diversity between LSMs than previously indicated, although it remains unclear why LSMs are broadly performing so much worse than simple empirical models.},

An overview of the experiment and model behavior at the global scale is described here, along with a determination and characterization of multimodel “consensus” skill. The models show modest but significant skill in predicting air temperatures, especially where the rain gauge network is dense. Given that precipitation is the chief driver of soil moisture, and thereby assuming that rain gauge density is a reasonable proxy for the adequacy of the observational network contributing to soil moisture initialization, this result indeed highlights the potential contribution of enhanced observations to prediction. Land-derived precipitation forecast skill is much weaker than that for air temperature. The skill for predicting air temperature, and to some extent precipitation, increases with the magnitude of the initial soil moisture anomaly. GLACE-2 results are examined further to provide insight into the asymmetric impacts of wet and dry soil moisture initialization on skill.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the model SCOPE (Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry and Energy fluxes), which is a vertical (1-D) integrated radiative transfer and energy balance model. The model links visible to thermal infrared radiance spectra (0.4 to 50 \&mu;m) as observed above the canopy to the fluxes of water, heat and carbon dioxide, as a function of vegetation structure, and the vertical profiles of temperature. Output of the model is the spectrum of outgoing radiation in the viewing direction and the turbulent heat fluxes, photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence. A special routine is dedicated to the calculation of photosynthesis rate and chlorophyll fluorescence at the leaf level as a function of net radiation and leaf temperature. The fluorescence contributions from individual leaves are integrated over the canopy layer to calculate top-of-canopy fluorescence. The calculation of radiative transfer and the energy balance is fully integrated, allowing for feedback between leaf temperatures, leaf chlorophyll fluorescence and radiative fluxes. Leaf temperatures are calculated on the basis of energy balance closure. Model simulations were evaluated against observations reported in the literature and against data collected during field campaigns. These evaluations showed that SCOPE is able to reproduce realistic radiance spectra, directional radiance and energy balance fluxes. The model may be applied for the design of algorithms for the retrieval of evapotranspiration from optical and thermal earth observation data, for validation of existing methods to monitor vegetation functioning, to help interpret canopy fluorescence measurements, and to study the relationships between synoptic observations with diurnally integrated quantities. The model has been implemented in Matlab and has a modular design, thus allowing for great flexibility and scalability.},

	abstract = {The Soil Canopy Observation of Photosynthesis and Energy fluxes (SCOPE) model aims at linking satellite observations in the visible, infrared, and thermal domains with land surface processes in a physically based manner, and quantifying the microclimate in vegetation canopies. It simulates radiative transfer in the soil, leaves, and vegetation canopies, as well as photosynthesis and non-radiative heat dissipation through convection and mechanical turbulence. Since the first publication 12 years ago, SCOPE has been applied in remote sensing studies of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), energy balance fluxes, gross primary production (GPP), and directional thermal signals. Here, we present a thoroughly revised version, SCOPE 2.0, which features a number of new elements: (1) it enables the definition of layers consisting of leaves with different properties, thus enabling the simulation of vegetation with an understorey or with a vertical gradient in leaf chlorophyll concentration; (2) it enables the simulation of soil reflectance; (3) it includes the simulation of leaf and canopy reflectance changes induced by the xanthophyll cycle; and (4) the computation speed has been reduced by 90 \% compared to earlier versions due to a fundamental optimization of the model. These new features improve the capability of the model to represent complex canopies and to explore the response of remote sensing signals to vegetation physiology. The improvements in computational efficiency make it possible to use SCOPE 2.0 routinely for the simulation of satellite data and land surface fluxes. It also strengthens the operability for the numerical retrieval of land surface products from satellite or airborne data.},

Different methods for modelling the stability near the surface are investigated with the surface temperatures and turbulent heat fluxes compared with data collected from the site. The results show that, whilst using Monin-Obukhov similarity theory can give good results in stable conditions, the form of the stability functions can significantly affect the accuracy in certain stability regimes. The use of log-linear stability functions can cause the turbulent fluxes of heat and moisture to cut off at stabilities which are too close to neutral compared with the observations. The results also show that unrealistically high surface temperatures are obtained in clear-sky nocturnal conditions with the standard surface energy balance. An alternative energy balance which includes a canopy of vegetation above the underlying soil gives better agreement with the observations in these conditions.},

A revised land surface hydrology (H-TESSEL) is introduced in the ECMWF operational model to address shortcomings of the land surface scheme, specifically the lack of surface runoff and the choice of a global uniform soil texture. New infiltration and runoff schemes are introduced with a dependency on the soil texture and standard deviation of orography. A set of experiments in stand-alone mode is used to assess the improved prediction of soil moisture at the local scale against field site observations. Comparison with basin-scale water balance (BSWB) and Global Runoff Data Centre (GRDC) datasets indicates a consistently larger dynamical range of land water mass over large continental areas and an improved prediction of river runoff, while the effect on atmospheric fluxes is fairly small. Finally, the ECMWF data assimilation and prediction systems are used to verify the effect on surface and near-surface quantities in the atmospheric-coupled mode. A midlatitude error reduction is seen both in soil moisture and in 2-m temperature.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews methods for estimating evaporation from landscapes, regions and larger geographic extents, with remotely sensed surface temperatures, and highlights uncertainties and limitations associated with those estimation methods. Particular attention is given to the validation of such approaches against ground based flux measurements. An assessment of some 30 published validations shows an average root mean squared error value of about 50 W m−2 and relative errors of 15–30\%. The comparison also shows that more complex physical and analytical methods are not necessarily more accurate than empirical and statistical approaches. While some of the methods were developed for specific land covers (e.g. irrigation areas only) we also review methods developed for other disciplines, such as hydrology and meteorology, where continuous estimates in space and in time are needed, thereby focusing on physical and analytical methods as empirical methods are usually limited by in situ training data. This review also provides a discussion of temporal and spatial scaling issues associated with the use of thermal remote sensing for estimating evaporation. Improved temporal scaling procedures are required to extrapolate instantaneous estimates to daily and longer time periods and gap-filling procedures are needed when temporal scaling is affected by intermittent satellite coverage. It is also noted that analysis of multi-resolution data from different satellite/sensor systems (i.e. data fusion) will assist in the development of spatial scaling and aggregation approaches, and that several biological processes need to be better characterized in many current land surface models.},

	abstract = {The newly developed land surface scheme SURFEX (SURFace EXternalisee) is implemented into a limited-area numerical weather prediction model running operationally in a number of countries of the ALADIN and HIRLAM consortia. The primary question addressed is the ability of SURFEX to be used as a new land surface scheme and thus assessing its potential use in an operational configuration instead of the original ISBA (Interactions between Soil, Biosphere, and Atmosphere) scheme. The results show that the introduction of SURFEX either shows improvement for or has a neutral impact on the 2 m temperature, 2 m relative humidity and 10 m wind. However, it seems that SURFEX has a tendency to produce higher maximum temperatures at high-elevation stations during winter daytime, which degrades the 2 m temperature scores. In addition, surface radiative and energy fluxes improve compared to observations from the Cabauw tower. The results also show that promising improvements with a demonstrated positive impact on the forecast performance are achieved by introducing the town energy balance (TEB) scheme. It was found that the use of SURFEX has a neutral impact on the precipitation scores. However, the implementation of TEB within SURFEX for a high-resolution run tends to cause rainfall to be locally concentrated, and the total accumulated precipitation obviously decreases during the summer. One of the novel features developed in SURFEX is the availability of a more advanced surface data assimilation using the extended Kalman filter. The results over Belgium show that the forecast scores are similar between the extended Kalman filter and the classical optimal interpolation scheme. Finally, concerning the vertical scores, the introduction of SURFEX either shows improvement for or has a neutral impact in the free atmosphere.},

The differences inthese three schemes and the resulting surface exchange coefficients do not, in general, lead to significant differences in model simulated surface fluxes, skin temperature, andprecipitation, provided the same treatment of roughness length for heat is employed.Rather, the model is more sensitive to the choice of the roughness length for heat. To assess the latter, we also tested two approaches to specifythe roughness length for heat: 1) assuming the roughness length for heat is a fixed ratio of the roughness length for momentum, and 2) relating this ratio to the roughness Reynolds number as proposed by Zilitinkevich.Our 1-D column model sensitivity tests suggested that the Zilitinkevich approach can improve the surface heat fluxand skin temperature simulations. A long-term test with the NCEP mesoscaleEta model indicated that this approach can also reduce forecast precipitation bias. Based on these simulations, in January 1996 we operationally implemented the Paulsonscheme with the new land-surface scheme of the NCEP Eta model, along with the Zilitinkevich formulation to specify the roughness length for heat.},

	abstract = {The roughness of the land surface (z0) is a key property, exerting significant influence on the amount of near-surface turbulent activity and consequently the turbulent exchange of energy, water, momentum, and chemical species between the land and the atmosphere. Variations in z0 are substantial across different types of land cover, ranging from typically less than 1 mm over fresh snow or sand deserts up to more than 1 m over urban areas or forests. In this study, we revise the parameterizations and parameter choices related to z0 in the Community Land Model 5.1 (CLM), the land component of the Community Earth System Model (CESM). We propose a number modifications for z0 in CLM, guided by observational data. Most importantly, we find that the observations support an increase in z0 for all types of forests and a decrease in the momentum z0 for bare soil, snow, glaciers, and crops. We then assess the effect of those modifications in land-only and land–atmosphere coupled simulations. With the revised parameterizations, diurnal variations of the land surface temperature (LST) are dampened in forested regions and are amplified over warm deserts. These changes mitigate model biases compared to MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote sensing observations. The changes in LST are generally stronger during the day than at night. For example, the LST increases by 5.1 K at 13:30 local solar time but only by 0.6 K at 01:30 during boreal summer across the entire Sahara. The induced changes in the diurnal variability of near-surface air temperatures are generally of the opposite sign and of smaller magnitude. Near-surface winds accelerate in areas where the momentum z0 was lowered, such as the Sahara, the Middle East, and Antarctica, and decelerate in regions with forests. Overall, this study finds that the current representation of z0 in CLM is not in agreement with observational constraints for several types of land cover. The proposed model modifications are shown to considerably alter the simulated climate in terms of temperatures and wind speed at the land surface.},

Explicit expressions for the stability-dependent, surface exchange coefficient developed by Louis are used. The diurnal variation of potential evaporation is computed for the stability-dependent and original Penman relationships using Wangara data. The influence of afternoon instability increases the aerodynamic term of the modified Penman relationship by 50\% or more on days with moderate instability. However, the unmodified Penman relationship predicts values of daily potential evaporation close to that of the stability-dependent relationship. This agreement is partly due to compensating overestimation during nighttime hours. Errors due to use of daily-averaged variables are examined in detail by evaluating the nonlinear interactions between the diurnal variation of the variables in the Penman relationship. A simpler method for estimating the exchange coefficient is constructed from an empirical relationship between the radiation Richardson number and the Obukhov length. This method is less accurate, but it allows estimation of the stability-dependent exchange coefficient using only parameters already required for evaluation of the Penman relationship. Finally, the diurnal variation of the atmospheric resistance coefficient appearing in the Penman-Monteith relationship is presented.},

	abstract = {We assess the simulations of global-scale evapotranspiration from the Global Soil Wetness Project Phase 2 (GSWP-2) within a global water-budget framework. The scatter in the GSWP-2 global evapotranspiration estimates from various land surface models can constrain the global, annual water budget fluxes to within ±2.5\%, and by using estimates of global precipitation, the residual ocean evaporation estimate falls within the range of other independently derived bulk estimates. However, the GSWP-2 scatter cannot entirely explain the imbalance of the annual fluxes from a modern-era, observationally-based global water budget assessment, and inconsistencies in the magnitude and timing of seasonal variations between the global water budget terms are found. Inter-model inconsistencies in evapotranspiration are largest for high latitude inter-annual variability as well as for inter-seasonal variations in the tropics, and analyses with field-scale data also highlights model disparity at estimating evapotranspiration in high latitude regions. Analyses of the sensitivity simulations that replace uncertain forcings (i.e. radiation, precipitation, and meteorological variables) indicate that global (land) evapotranspiration is slightly more sensitive to precipitation than net radiation perturbations, and the majority of the GSWP-2 models, at a global scale, fall in a marginally moisture-limited evaporative condition. Finally, the range of global evapotranspiration estimates among the models is larger than any bias caused by uncertainties in the GSWP-2 atmospheric forcing, indicating that model structure plays a more important role toward improving global land evaporation estimates (as opposed to improved atmospheric forcing).},

	abstract = {A global intercomparison of 12 monthly mean land surface heat flux products for the period 1993–1995 is presented. The intercomparison includes some of the first emerging global satellite-based products (developed at Paris Observatory, Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry, University of California Berkeley, University of Maryland, and Princeton University) and examples of fluxes produced by reanalyses (ERA-Interim, MERRA, NCEP-DOE) and off-line land surface models (GSWP-2, GLDAS CLM/Mosaic/Noah). An intercomparison of the global latent heat flux (Qle) annual means shows a spread of ∼20 W m−2 (all-product global average of ∼45 W m−2). A similar spread is observed for the sensible (Qh) and net radiative (Rn) fluxes. In general, the products correlate well with each other, helped by the large seasonal variability and common forcing data for some of the products. Expected spatial distributions related to the major climatic regimes and geographical features are reproduced by all products. Nevertheless, large Qle and Qh absolute differences are also observed. The fluxes were spatially averaged for 10 vegetation classes. The larger Qle differences were observed for the rain forest but, when normalized by mean fluxes, the differences were comparable to other classes. In general, the correlations between Qle and Rn were higher for the satellite-based products compared with the reanalyses and off-line models. The fluxes were also averaged for 10 selected basins. The seasonality was generally well captured by all products, but large differences in the flux partitioning were observed for some products and basins.},

	abstract = {Abstract Proper partitioning of the surface energy fluxes that drive the evolution of the planetary boundary layer in numerical weather prediction models requires an accurate representation of initial land surface conditions. Unfortunately, soil temperature and moisture observations are unavailable in most areas and routine daily estimates of vegetation coverage and biomass are not easily available. This gap in observational capabilities seriously hampers the evaluation and improvement of land surface parameterizations, since model errors likely relate to improper initial conditions as much as to inaccuracies in the parameterizations. Two unique datasets help to overcome these difficulties. First, 1-km fractional vegetation coverage and leaf area index values can be derived from biweekly maximum normalized difference vegetation index composites obtained from daily observations by the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer onboard NOAA satellites. Second, the Oklahoma Mesonet supplies multiple soil temperature and moisture measurements at various soil depths each hour. Combined, these two datasets provide significantly improved initial conditions for a land surface model and allow an evaluation of the accuracy of the land surface model with much greater confidence than previously. Forecasts that both include and neglect these unique land surface observations are used to evaluate the value of these two data sources to land surface initializations. The dense network of surface observations afforded by the Oklahoma Mesonet, including surface flux data derived from special sensors, provides verification of the model results, which indicate that predicted latent heat fluxes still differ from observations by as much as 150 W m−2. This result provides a springboard for assessing parameterization errors within the model. A new empirical parameterization developed using principal-component regression reveals simple relationships between latent heat flux and other surface observations. Periods of very dry conditions observed across Oklahoma are used advantageously to derive a parameterization for evaporation from bare soil. Combining this parameterization with an empirical canopy transpiration scheme yields improved sensible and latent heat flux forecasts and better partitioning of the surface energy budget. Surface temperature and mixing ratio forecasts show improvement when compared with observations.},

It has four prognostic layers in the soil for temperature and soil moisture, with a free drainage and a zero heat flux condition at the bottom as a boundary condition. The scheme has been extensively tested in stand-alone mode with the help of long observational time series from three different experiments with different climatological regimes: the First ISLSCP (International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project) Field Experiment in the United States, Cabauw in the Netherlands, and the Amazonian Rainforest Meteorological Experiment in Brazil. The emphasis is on seasonal timescales because it was felt that the main deficiencies in the old ECMWF land surface scheme were related to its capability of storing precipitation in spring and making it available for evaporation later in the year. It is argued that the stand-alone testing is particularly important, because it allows one to isolate problems in the land surface scheme without having to deal with complicated interactions in the full three-dimensional model.},

	abstract = {The surface layer is the interface between the atmosphere and land surface where the exchange of momentum, sensible heat, and latent heat occurs. All atmospheric models parameterize the effects of the surface layer using Monin-Obukhov similarity theory, which assumes logarithmic wind, temperature, and moisture profiles for the surface layer that are adjusted through the use of empirically-derived stability functions. In order to address the limitations of similarity theory, we have developed a machine learning surface layer parameterization and implemented it within the WRF Single Column Model. We trained random forests on observations from sites in the Netherlands and Idaho. The random forest models predict the friction velocity, temperature scale, and moisture scale for a given atmospheric profile. These parameters are used to derive the momentum, sensible heat, and latent heat fluxes as well as the heat and moisture exchange coefficients used to force the land surface model. In offline comparisons with observations at both Cabauw and Idaho, the random forest model outperforms similarity theory in estimating fluxes, even when training the model in one location and applying to the other. In WRF SCM runs, the random forest surface layer parameterization generally reproduces the diurnal cycle of the boundary layer for both temperature and moisture. We will discuss how different data processing strategies affect the machine learning model sensitivities and the physical consistency of the WRF single column model runs. We use machine learning interpretation techniques, such as partial dependence plots and permutation variable importance, to investigate the sensitivities of both the random forests and similarity theory. We will also discuss how the machine learning parameterizations perform when paired with different land surface model and boundary layer scheme options.},

	abstract = {The Canadian Land Surface Scheme “CLASS” was developed in the late 1980s for the Canadian GCM, in response to the perceived need for a “second‐generation “ land surface model which would adequately treat the effects of vegetation, snow and soil on exchanges of heat and moisture with the atmosphere. CLASS has been tested both in coupled mode with the GCM and in various experiments that have been carried out in conjunction with PILPS, the international Project for Intercomparison of Land‐Surface Parameterization Schemes. In the context of those runs, CLASS has been shown to perform quite ‐well. However, it is recognized that a more rigorous framework of testing against field data is required before the model can be used with confidence for studies involving the scaling up of surface fluxes, or the modelling of severely heterogeneous landscapes. The series of papers which follows (to which this one provides an introductory overview) describes the testing of CLASS against a wide variety of micrometeorological dataseis, and the model development that has proceeded alongside this work, under the auspices of the Canadian Climate Research Network, from 1994 to 1997. The highlights of this research include the development of new algorithms for bare soil evaporation; forest transpiration; heat and moisture transfers in organic soils; and regional‐scale river routing.},

	abstract = {This first paper of the two-part series describes the objectives of the community efforts in improving the Noah land surface model (LSM), documents, through mathematical formulations, the augmented conceptual realism in biophysical and hydrological processes, and introduces a framework for multiple options to parameterize selected processes (Noah-MP). The Noah-MP's performance is evaluated at various local sites using high temporal frequency data sets, and results show the advantages of using multiple optional schemes to interpret the differences in modeling simulations. The second paper focuses on ensemble evaluations with long-term regional (basin) and global scale data sets. The enhanced conceptual realism includes (1) the vegetation canopy energy balance, (2) the layered snowpack, (3) frozen soil and infiltration, (4) soil moisture-groundwater interaction and related runoff production, and (5) vegetation phenology. Sample local-scale validations are conducted over the First International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Field Experiment (FIFE) site, the W3 catchment of Sleepers River, Vermont, and a French snow observation site. Noah-MP shows apparent improvements in reproducing surface fluxes, skin temperature over dry periods, snow water equivalent (SWE), snow depth, and runoff over Noah LSM version 3.0. Noah-MP improves the SWE simulations due to more accurate simulations of the diurnal variations of the snow skin temperature, which is critical for computing available energy for melting. Noah-MP also improves the simulation of runoff peaks and timing by introducing a more permeable frozen soil and more accurate simulation of snowmelt. We also demonstrate that Noah-MP is an effective research tool by which modeling results for a given process can be interpreted through multiple optional parameterization schemes in the same model framework.},

It is designed to serve as a lower boundary in a mesoscale atmospheric model and is intended to be used to study the influence of the land surface on regional atmospheric circulations and climate. The land surface model contains one vegetation layer, a soil skin layer, and four subsurface soil layers. The shortwave and longwave radiation schemes are based on the two-stream theory. Turbulent transfer is treated in a very simple manner, by considering canopy–air and ground–air exchanges separately. Plant water flow is governed by differences in water potential between the soil and the leaves. The stomatal resistance formulation uses the effective leaf area index and the leaf water potential as key variables. It is shown that the resulting transpiration scheme implicitly accounts for the influence of visible radiation, soil moisture, atmospheric saturation deficit, and leaf temperature. The results of four validation experiments are shown. Parameters were chosen prior to the model runs, and no tuning was involved. These experiments show that the surface model is capable of reproducing observed fluxes within instrumental error including timescales ranging from rapid weather changes up to several months.},

	abstract = {AbstractThe Community Land Model (CLM) exhibits biases in evapotranspiration (ET) and total water storage (TWS) in semiarid regions. The TWS seasonal cycle amplitude is too low, while evapotranspiration is too strong and variable. These biases are consistent with excessive soil evaporation when the canopy is sparse or absent, which reduces moisture inputs into the ground. Here we improve the simulation of soil evaporation by replacing CLM's existing empirical soil resistance parameterization with a more mechanistically based formulation in which soil evaporation is controlled by the rate of diffusion of water vapor through a dry surface layer (DSL). The thickness of the DSL is parameterized as a soil-type dependent function of top layer soil moisture. Soil resistances are calculated from the DSL thickness combined with a soil tortuosity factor. Compared to the existing CLM soil resistance parameterization, the DSL-based soil resistances for a given soil moisture value are generally larger, especially for moister soils. CLM simulations using the DSL-based soil resistance expression have reduced biases of ET relative to the FLUXNET-MTE (Model Tree Ensemble) data set and TWS relative to Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) observations. Averaged over global semiarid regions, the CLM mean annual amplitude of TWS increases from 26.3 mm to 32.5 mm when the new soil resistance parameterization is used, in good agreement with the GRACE mean annual amplitude for these regions of 32.2 ±2.1 mm. CLM mean annual ET, averaged over global semiarid regions, decreases from 27.8 mm/month to 23.5 mm/month, closer to the FLUXNET-MTE mean annual ET of 21.1 ± 0.9 mm/month. The seasonal amplitude of CLM ET also decreases, from 23.3 mm/month to 18.3 mm/month compared to 14.9 ± 1.1 mm/month for FLUXNET-MTE.},

	abstract = {Abstract The CTP-HIlow framework for describing atmospheric controls on soil moisture–boundary layer interactions is described in a companion paper, . In this paper, the framework is applied to the continental United States to investigate how differing atmospheric regimes influence local feedbacks between the land surface and the atmosphere. The framework was developed with a one-dimensional boundary layer model and is based on two measures of atmospheric thermodynamic properties: the convective triggering potential (CTP), a measure of the temperature lapse rate between approximately 1 and 3 km above the ground surface, and a low-level humidity index, HIlow. These two measures are used to distinguish between three types of early-morning atmospheric conditions: those favoring moist convection over dry soils, those favoring moist convection over wet soils, and those that will allow or prevent deep convective activity, independent of the surface flux partitioning. Analyses of multiyear CTP-HIlow scatterplots from radiosonde stations across the contiguous 48 United States reveal that during the summer months (June, July, and August) positive feedbacks between soil moisture and moist convection are likely in much of the eastern half of the country. Over the western half of the country, atmospheric conditions and the likelihood of moist convection are largely determined by oceanic influences, and land surface conditions in the summer are unlikely to impact convective triggering. The only area showing a potential negative feedback is in the dryline and monsoon region of the arid Southwest. This potential arises because of the topography of this and surrounding regions. A relatively narrow band of stations lies in between the eastern and western portions of the country, in some years behaving like the stations to the west and in other years behaving like the stations to the east.},

A one-dimensional model of the atmospheric boundary layer (BL) is initialized with atmospheric sounding data from Illinois and with the soil moisture set to either extremely wet (saturated) or extremely dry (20\% of saturation) conditions. Two measures are developed to assess the low-level temperature and humidity structure of the early-morning atmosphere. These two measures are used to distinguish between four types of soundings, based on the likely outcome of the model: 1) those soundings favoring deep convection over dry soils, 2) those favoring deep convection over wet soils, 3) those unlikely to convect over any land surface, and 4) those likely to convect over any land surface. Examples of the first two cases are presented in detail. The early-morning atmosphere is characterized in this work by the newly developed convective triggering potential (CTP) and a low-level humidity index, HIlow. The CTP measures the departure from a moist adiabatic temperature lapse rate in the region between 100 and 300 mb (about 1–3 km) above the ground surface (AGS). This region is the critical interface between the near-surface region, which is almost always incorporated into the growing BL, and free atmospheric air, which is almost never incorporated into the BL. Together, these two measures form the CTP-HIlow framework for analyzing atmospheric controls on soil moisture–boundary layer interactions. Results show that in Illinois deep convection is trigged in the model 22\% of the time over wet soils and only 13\% of the time over dry soils. Additional testing varying the radiative conditions in Illinois and also using the 1D model with soundings from four additional stations confirm that the CTP-HIlow framework is valid for regions far removed from Illinois.},

SM-ET is a local process that is relatively easy to quantify, but ET-P includes nonlocal atmospheric processes and is more complex. Here, ET-P is quantified both locally and remotely with a back-trajectory method for water vapor transport, using corrected reanalysis data. It is found that, for SM-P and ET-P, local impact is greater than that from remote for most land areas with significant local impacts. By examining the responses of the three metrics (SM-ET, ET-P, and SM-P) to climate variations over different climate regimes, we show that SM-ET is the principal factor that determines the spatial pattern and variation of SM-P. For climatologically wet regions, SM-ET and SM-P are higher during dry periods, and vice versa for climatologically dry regions. All three metrics show highest values over the transitional zones.},

	abstract = {Abstract This study investigates the impacts of historical land-cover change on summer afternoon precipitation over North America using the Community Earth System Model. Using land–atmosphere coupling metrics, this study examines the sensitivity of afternoon atmospheric conditions to morning land surface states and fluxes that are altered by land-cover changes before and since 1850. The deforestation in the eastern United States prior to 1850 leads to increased latent but decreased sensible heat flux during the morning and a reduction in afternoon precipitation over the southern regions of the U.S. East Coast. The agricultural expansion over the Great Plains since preindustrial times shows similar effects on surface fluxes but results in a significant widespread increase in precipitation over the crop area. The coupling metrics exhibit a strong positive soil moisture–precipitation relationship over the Great Plains. Impacts of land-cover change on precipitation manifest through changes in rainfall frequency, rather than intensity, that are largely controlled by the distribution of CAPE as the trigger of convective precipitation. However, deforestation and later reforestation over the eastern United States, where coupling properties are different than the Great Plains, do not have as dominant an effect on afternoon precipitation. Additionally, precipitation over parts of the U.S. Southwest decreases in this model during the earlier period of East Coast deforestation, owing to changes in the large-scale circulation over North America driven by land-use changes prior to 1850.},

Maps of this sensitivity index show strong agreement with “hot spots” of land-atmosphere coupling and land-driven predictability enhancement found in other studies. The index is found to be robust across data from land surface models driven by observations and free-running global coupled land-atmosphere models, but is compromised in reanalysis data due to inflated interannual variability in soil moisture caused by non-stationarity in the satellite observing system that is used in data assimilation.

Recent observational evidence of afternoon rain falling preferentially over land parcels that are drier than the surrounding areas (negative spatial effect), contrasts with previous reports of a predominant positive temporal effect. However, whether spatial effects relating to soil moisture heterogeneity translate into similar temporal effects remains unknown. Here we show that afternoon precipitation events tend to occur during wet and heterogeneous soil moisture conditions, while being located over comparatively drier patches. Using remote-sensing data and a common analysis framework, spatial and temporal correlations with opposite signs are shown to coexist within the same region and data set. Positive temporal coupling might enhance precipitation persistence, while negative spatial coupling tends to regionally homogenize land surface conditions. Although the apparent positive temporal coupling does not necessarily imply a causal relationship, these results reconcile the notions of moisture recycling with local, spatially negative feedbacks.},

Beyond u*zo/v = 100, there is no unique value of kB−1, but rather the observations suggest that the behaviour falls into either of two categories. For surfaces comprised of arrays of widely spaced solid roughness elements, kB−1 continues to increase (with some evidence for a plateau being reached by about u*zo/v = 1,000, when kB−1 ≃ 10), whilst for surfaces comprised of randomly distributed fibrous roughness elements, kB−1 gradually decreases with increasing roughness Reynolds number beyond about 100.},

We examined station and gridded precipitation observations for the warm season months over and downwind of the Ogallala over the 20th century. Increases in precipitation of 15–30\% were detected during July from the easternmost part of the aquifer to as far downwind as Indiana. The timing (1940s, July) and spatial pattern of the precipitation increase are consistent with the history of Ogallala irrigation and mechanisms by which increases in evapotranspiration can affect convection. Additionally, we conducted a vapor tracking analysis and found that evapotranspiration over the Ogallala Aquifer contributes to downwind precipitation and that the contribution is greater when the evapotranspiration is higher. This makes it hydrologically possible that the irrigation development was associated with the observed precipitation increases. Finally, there is no clear evidence that atmospheric circulation changes or modes of internal climate variability increased the July precipitation. Further analysis of the influence of Ogallala irrigation on precipitation will include the controlled analysis of climate model simulations that explicitly include irrigation.},

Our analysis demonstrates that it is not possible to explain the tropics-wide partitioning of precipitation unless one assumes that rain is favored over land. Land receives more than its fair share of precipitation by broadening and letting the tropical rainbelts move more, effectively underpinning a negative feedback between surface water storage and precipitation. In contrast, rain is disfavored over land in climate models. Our findings suggest that the abundance of rainfall that shapes the terrestrial tropical biosphere is more robust to perturbations than models have suggested.},

	abstract = {Abstract Moist convection is a key aspect of the extratropical summer climate and strongly affects the delicate balance of processes that determines the surface climate in response to larger-scale forcings. Previous studies using parameterized convection have found that the feedback between soil moisture and precipitation is predominantly positive (more precipitation over wet soils) over Europe. Here this feedback is investigated for one full month (July 2006) over the Alpine region using two different model configurations. The first one employs regional climate simulations performed with the Consortium for Small-Scale Modeling Model in Climate Mode (CCLM) on a grid spacing of 25 km. The second one uses the same model but integrated on a cloud-resolving grid of 2.2 km, allowing an explicit treatment of convection. Each configuration comprises one control and two sensitivity experiments. The latter start from perturbed soil moisture initial conditions. Comparison of the simulated soil moisture–precipitation feedback reveals significant differences between the two systems. The 25-km simulations sustain a strong positive feedback, while those at 2.2-km resolution are associated with a predominantly negative feedback. Thus the two systems yield not only different strengths of this key feedback but also different signs. This has important implications, with the cloud-resolving model exhibiting a shorter soil moisture memory and a smaller soil moisture–temperature feedback. Analysis shows that the different feedback signs relate to the sensitivity of the simulated convective development to the presence of a stable layer sitting on top of the planetary boundary layer. In the 2.2-km integrations, dry initial soil moisture conditions yield more vigorous thermals (owing to stronger daytime heating), which can more easily break through the stable air barrier, thereby leading to deep convection and ultimately to a negative soil moisture–precipitation feedback loop. In the 25-km integrations, deep convection is much less sensitive to the stable layer because of the design of the employed convective parameterization. The authors also show that there are considerable differences in the simulated soil moisture–precipitation feedback between low-resolution modeling frameworks using different cloud convection schemes.},

Large-eddy simulations are used to disentangle the processes at play in a typical case of daytime triggering of deep convection over a semi-arid land. We show that the presence of a realistic surface sensible heat flux heterogeneity leads to an earlier triggering of convection and induces a strong determinism in the triggering location at the beta-mesoscale (i.e. ∼50 km). The transition to deep convection consists of three consecutive stages, each one corresponding to a specific mode of interaction between (i) the boundary-layer thermals (small-scale), (ii) the breeze circulation (mesoscale) and (iii) the background wind (synoptic scale). These stages are both interpreted thermodynamically and morphologically. All along the transition phase, the boundary-layer growth acts to slow down the background wind, which strengthens the breeze circulation. The breeze evolves towards a circular shape which optimizes moisture convergence and cloud formation just prior to triggering. The presence of wind shear leads with a more asymmetric shape of the breeze in the afternoon, associated with a preferential triggering on the down-shear side of the breeze circulation.},

However, climatic effects of land management practices have been little discussed and compared to land-use impacts. As land-atmosphere interactions via surface fluxes are particularly strong during the warm season, we investigate the impacts of historical land use and present irrigation practices on summer temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere using the most recent version of Community Earth System Model. Our results suggest that historical land use leads to an overall cooling in the middle latitudes and a warming in the tropics, and the sign and magnitude of the changes in temperature depend on the type of land cover change. On the other hand, summer irrigation leads to a significant cooling over many irrigated areas due to enhanced evapotranspiration, and the local cooling is comparable to and even stronger than the land-use effects. Both land use and irrigation can also significantly influence the intensity and frequency of hot extremes. Land use shows stronger impacts during the night through ground heat flux feedback, while irrigation shows stronger impacts during the day through latent heat flux feedback. Our comparison demonstrates the importance of irrigation in local and regional climate, highlighting the necessity of considering such land management practices in future assessments of regional climate change and climate mitigation.},

	abstract = {Land use/land cover change (LULCC) exerts significant influence on regional climate extremes, but its relative importance compared with other anthropogenic climate forcings has not been thoroughly investigated. This study compares land use forcing with other forcing agents in explaining the simulated historical temperature extreme changes since preindustrial times in the CESM-Last Millennium Ensemble (LME) project. CESM-LME suggests that the land use forcing has caused an overall cooling in both warm and cold extremes, and has significantly decreased diurnal temperature range (DTR). Due to the competing effects of the GHG and aerosol forcings, the spatial pattern of changes in 1850–2005 climatology of temperature extremes in CESM-LME can be largely explained by the land use forcing, especially for hot extremes and DTR. The dominance of land use forcing is particularly evident over Europe, eastern China, and the central and eastern US. Temporally, the land-use cooling is relatively stable throughout the historical period, while the warming of temperature extremes is mainly influenced by the enhanced GHG forcing, which has gradually dampened the local dominance of the land use effects. Results from the suite of CMIP5 experiments partially agree with the local dominance of the land use forcing in CESM-LME, but inter-model discrepancies exist in the distribution and sign of the LULCC-induced temperature changes. Our results underline the overall importance of LULCC in historical temperature extreme changes, implying land use forcing should be highlighted in future climate projections.},

	abstract = {Investigation on the climatic effects of irrigation is of great significance to fully understand the impact of water management on the Earth's environment and hydrological cycle. To comprehensively explore the effects of irrigation across different climatic regions over China, we propose a novel combined irrigation scheme (including dynamic and fixed irrigation schemes) into the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)-Noah-mosaic model. Two experiments (with and without irrigation) are designed to simulate the impacts of irrigation over China on regional climate. As irrigation increases the latent heat flux but decreases the sensible heat flux and surface temperature, and the magnitudes of corresponding change are highly dependent on the irrigation amounts and irrigation fraction, the evaporative cooling effects significantly reduce the warm bias over extensive irrigation area during crop growing seasons. Meanwhile, irrigation increases soil moisture during both irrigated and non-irrigated seasons. Compared with the dynamic irrigation scheme, the fixed irrigation scheme results in relatively higher subsurface runoffs due to the continuous infiltration. In addition, the irrigation-induced changes on precipitation during spring (March–May) are weaker than that during summer (June–August). The opposed effects of irrigation cooling and wetting on generating convective precipitation, and the irrigation-induced changes in large-scale circulation jointly give rise to the heterogeneous changes of precipitation. Besides, the subgrid-scale irrigation scheme can capture the climatic effects of irrigation in some grids where the dominant land use types are not cropland, indicating that in mesoscale simulation, climate model coupled with subgrid-scale irrigation scheme may improve climate variables trends attribution studies.},

	abstract = {There is strong evidence that the expansion and intensification of irrigation over the twentieth century has affected climate in many regions. However, it remains uncertain if these irrigation effects, including buffered warming trends, will weaken or persist under future climate change conditions. Using a 20-member climate model ensemble simulation, we demonstrate that irrigation will continue to attenuate greenhouse gas-forced warming and soil moisture drying in many regions over the 21st century, including Mexico, the Mediterranean, Southwest Asia, and China. Notably, this occurs without any further expansion or intensification of irrigation beyond current levels, even while greenhouse gas forcing steadily increases. However, the magnitude and significance of these moderating irrigation effects vary across regions and are highly sensitive to the background climate state and the degree to which evapotranspiration is supply (moisture) versus demand (energy) limited. Further, limitations on water and land availability may restrict our ability to maintain modern irrigation rates into the future. Nevertheless, it is likely that irrigation, alongside other components of intensive land management, will continue to strongly modulate regional climate impacts in the future. Irrigation should therefore be considered in conjunction with other key regional anthropogenic forcings (e.g., land cover change and aerosols) when investigating the local manifestation of global climate drivers (e.g., greenhouse gases) in model projections.},

This triggering is driven by evolving properties of the strongest boundary layer thermals. To investigate this, a statistical analysis of large-eddy simulation cloud fields in a case of transition from shallow to deep convection over a semiarid land is carried out at different stages of the transition from shallow to deep convection. Based on the dynamical and geometrical properties at cloud base, a new computation of the triggering is first proposed. The analysis of the distribution law of the maximum size of the thermals suggests that, in addition to this necessary condition, another triggering condition is required, that is, that this maximum horizontal size should exceed a certain threshold. This is explicitly represented stochastically. Therefore, the new formulation integrates the whole transition process from the first cloud to the first deep convective cell and can be decomposed into three steps: (i) the appearance of clouds, (ii) crossing of the inhibition layer, and (iii) deep convection triggering.},

The derivation of the formulation of this parameterization and the justification, based on large-eddy simulation results, for the main hypothesis was proposed in Part I of this study. Whereas the standard triggering formulation in LMDZ5B relies on the maximum vertical velocity within a mean bulk thermal, the new formulation presented here (i) considers a thermal size distribution instead of a bulk thermal, (ii) provides a statistical lifting energy at cloud base, (iii) proposes a three-step trigger (appearance of clouds, inhibition crossing, and exceeding of a cross-section threshold), and (iv) includes a stochastic component. Here the complete implementation is presented, with its coupling to the thermal model used to treat shallow convection in LMDZ5B. The parameterization is tested over various cases in a single-column model framework. A sensitivity study to each parameter introduced is also carried out. The impact of the new triggering is then evaluated in the single-column version of LMDZ on several case studies and in full 3D simulations. It is found that the new triggering (i) delays deep convection triggering, (ii) suppresses it over oceanic trade wind cumulus zones, (iii) increases the low-level cloudiness, and (iv) increases the convective variability. The scale-aware nature of this parameterization is also discussed.},

	abstract = {Morocco -as part of both the Mediterranean and North African region- has long been recognized as a major climate change hotspot where precipitation is projected to decline significantly. This can threaten the stability of many climate-sensitive sectors including water and agriculture. Effective management of such sectors requires a better understanding and assessment of climate variability and change in the regional context.Downscaling approaches are needed to bridge the gap between the coarse resolution of the Global Climate Models (GCMs) and the scales suitable for finer climate assessments and impact or adaptation studies. This is classically done through limited area Regional Climate Models (RCM) driven by large-scale fields from the global models. While these models can improve the representation of many processes including mesoscale circulation and orographic effects, they also suffer from weaknesses that can significantly alter the reliability of climate change projections. The potential inconsistencies between the physical parameterizations of the RCMs and its forcing GCMs, the incomplete description of some climate forcings, as well as some methodological choices may impact the results in a non-negligible way. It is also difficult to distinguish between the impact of a better description of small scales and the impact of systematic biases inherited from the forcing models.In this work, we examine the feasibility of using a variable resolution, global, general-circulation model LMDZ (Laboratoire de Meteorologie Dynamique, Z stands for zoom) in a coupled configuration (atmospheric/land-surface component of the IPSL climate model) using telescopic zooming and enhanced resolution (approx. 35 km) over North Africa to better reveal regional aspects of the distribution of the precipitation over Morocco and their response to global warming. The simulations produced with this configuration are compared to a hierarchy of simulations, including intermediate resolution global simulations (50km) and low-resolution AMIP simulations produced in the framework of the CMIP6 exercise. The simulations are evaluated against various sets of observations (stations and satellite-based datasets). Our results show clear improvements related to the increased resolution and the ability of the model to capture the main large-scale circulation patterns of interest for Morocco. In addition, the model clearly illustrates the impact of weather regimes on precipitation and temperature mean and extreme events. The next step will consist in using this configuration to produce and analyze downscaled climate projections, to better understand the mechanisms of regional climate change and quantify the uncertainties.},

	abstract = {Internal variability, multiple emission scenarios, and different model responses to anthropogenic forcing are ultimately behind a wide range of uncertainties that arise in climate change projections. Model weighting approaches are generally used to reduce the uncertainty related to the choice of the climate model. This study compares three multi-model combination approaches: a simple arithmetic mean and two recently developed weighting-based alternatives. One method takes into account models’ performance only and the other accounts for models’ performance and independence. The effect of these three multi-model approaches is assessed for projected changes of mean precipitation and temperature as well as four extreme indices over northern Morocco. We analyze different widely used high-resolution ensembles issued from statistical (NEXGDDP) and dynamical (Euro-CORDEX and bias-adjusted Euro-CORDEX) downscaling. For the latter, we also investigate the potential added value that bias adjustment may have over the raw dynamical simulations. Results show that model weighting can significantly reduce the spread of the future projections increasing their reliability. Nearly all model ensembles project a significant warming over the studied region (more intense inland than near the coasts), together with longer and more severe dry periods. In most cases, the different weighting methods lead to almost identical spatial patterns of climate change, indicating that the uncertainty due to the choice of multi-model combination strategy is nearly negligible.},

	abstract = {Observations evidence extremely stable boundary layers (SBL) over the Antarctic Plateau and sharp regime transitions between weakly and very stable conditions. Representing such features is a challenge for climate models. This study assesses the modeling of the dynamics of the boundary layer over the Antarctic Plateau in the LMDZ general circulation model. It uses 1 year simulations with a stretched-grid over Dome C. The model is nudged with reanalyses outside of the Dome C region such as simulations can be directly compared to in situ observations. We underline the critical role of the downward longwave radiation for modeling the surface temperature. LMDZ reasonably represents the near-surface seasonal profiles of wind and temperature but strong temperature inversions are degraded by enhanced turbulent mixing formulations. Unlike ERA-Interim reanalyses, LMDZ reproduces two SBL regimes and the regime transition, with a sudden increase in the near-surface inversion with decreasing wind speed. The sharpness of the transition depends on the stability function used for calculating the surface drag coefficient. Moreover, using a refined vertical grid leads to a better reversed “S-shaped” relationship between the inversion and the wind. Sudden warming events associated to synoptic advections of warm and moist air are also well reproduced. Near-surface supersaturation with respect to ice is not allowed in LMDZ but the impact on the SBL structure is moderate. Finally, climate simulations with the free model show that the recommended configuration leads to stronger inversions and winds over the ice-sheet. However, the near-surface wind remains underestimated over the slopes of East-Antarctica.},

In order to analyze the global influence of irrigation on the water cycle, the land surface model ORCHIDEE is coupled to the GCM LMDZ to simulate the impact of irrigation on climate. A 30-year simulation which takes into account irrigation is compared with a simulation which does not. Differences are usually not significant on average over all land surfaces but hydrological variables are significantly affected by irrigation over some of the main irrigated river basins. Significant impacts over the Mississippi river basin are shown to be contrasted between eastern and western regions. An increase in summer precipitation is simulated over the arid western region in association with enhanced evapotranspiration whereas a decrease in precipitation occurs over the wet eastern part of the basin. Over the Indian peninsula where irrigation is high during winter and spring, a delay of 6 days is found for the mean monsoon onset date when irrigation is activated, leading to a significant decrease in precipitation during May to July. Moreover, the higher decrease occurs in June when the water requirements by crops are maximum, exacerbating water scarcity in this region. A significant cooling of the land surfaces occurs during the period of high irrigation leading to a decrease of the land-sea heat contrast in June, which delays the monsoon onset.},

	abstract = {Various studies have documented the effects of modern-day irrigation on regional and global climate, but none, to date, have considered the time-varying impact of steadily increasing irrigation rates on climate during the 20th century. We investigate the impacts of observed irrigation changes over this century with two ensemble simulations using an atmosphere general circulation model. Both ensembles are forced with transient climate forcings and observed sea surface temperatures from 1902 to 2000; one ensemble includes irrigation specified by a time-varying data set of irrigation water withdrawals. Early in the century, irrigation is primarily localized over southern and eastern Asia, leading to significant cooling in boreal summer (June–August) over these regions. This cooling spreads and intensifies by century's end, following the rapid expansion of irrigation over North America, Europe, and Asia. Irrigation also leads to boreal winter (December–February) warming over parts of North America and Asia in the latter part of the century, due to enhanced downward longwave fluxes from increased near-surface humidity. Precipitation increases occur primarily downwind of the major irrigation areas, although precipitation in parts of India decreases due to a weaker summer monsoon. Irrigation begins to significantly reduce temperatures and temperature trends during boreal summer over the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes and tropics beginning around 1950; significant increases in precipitation occur in these same latitude bands. These trends reveal the varying importance of irrigation-climate interactions and suggest that future climate studies should account for irrigation, especially in regions with unsustainable irrigation resources.},

However, the link between irrigation and hydroclimate is not well understood in a dry region such as Saudi Arabia. In this study, we utilize three different regional climate models to explore the physical mechanisms behind the irrigation impacts in this region. The results are robust across models and show that when irrigation is applied, wetter soil results in higher evapotranspiration and cools the lower atmosphere, leading to an anomalous pressure field and alters vapor transportation. Precipitation decreases locally because of the local cooling effect, whereas additional water vapor convergence enhances precipitation west to the irrigated region. This west–east contrast of precipitation change indicates a possible link between irrigation expansion in the 1980s and subsequent decadal precipitation variations in central Saudi Arabia. We further find from observations a decadal west–east contrast of precipitation changes in Saudi Arabia to support the similar finding in the models. This study implies the importance of including anthropogenic water management in climate models and provides a better understanding of how irrigation impacts local-to-regional climate.},

	abstract = {Abstract Anthropogenic activities have been significantly perturbing global freshwater flows and groundwater reserves. Despite numerous advances in the development of land surface models (LSMs) and global terrestrial hydrological models (GHMs), relatively few studies have attempted to simulate the impacts of anthropogenic activities on the terrestrial water cycle using the framework of LSMs. From the comparison of simulated terrestrial water storage with the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite observations it is found that a process-based LSM, the Minimal Advanced Treatments of Surface Interaction and Runoff (MATSIRO), outperforms the bucket-model-based GHM called H08 in simulating hydrologic variables, particularly in water-limited regions. Therefore, the water regulation modules of H08 are incorporated into MATSIRO. Further, a new irrigation scheme based on the soil moisture deficit is developed. Incorporation of anthropogenic water regulation modules significantly improves river discharge simulation in the heavily regulated global river basins. Simulated irrigation water withdrawal for the year 2000 (2462 km3 yr−1) agrees well with the estimates provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Results indicate that irrigation changes surface energy balance, causing a maximum increase of {\textasciitilde}50 W m−2 in latent heat flux averaged over June–August. Moreover, unsustainable anthropogenic water use in 2000 is estimated to be {\textasciitilde}450 km3 yr−1, which corresponds well with documented records of groundwater overdraft, representing an encouraging improvement over the previous modeling studies. Globally, unsustainable water use accounts for {\textasciitilde}40\% of blue water used for irrigation. The representation of anthropogenic activities in MATSIRO makes the model a suitable tool for assessing potential anthropogenic impacts on global water resources and hydrology.},

	abstract = {Crop production requires large amounts of green and blue water. We developed the new global crop water model GCWM to compute consumptive water use (evapotranspiration) and virtual water content (evapotranspiration per harvested biomass) of crops at a spatial resolution of 5′ by 5′, distinguishing 26 crop classes, and blue versus green water. GCWM is based on the global land use data set MIRCA2000 that provides monthly growing areas for 26 crop classes under rainfed and irrigated conditions for the period 1998–2002 and represents multi-cropping. By computing daily soil water balances, GCWM determines evapotranspiration of blue and green water for each crop and grid cell. Cell-specific crop production under both rainfed and irrigated conditions is computed by downscaling average crop yields reported for 402 national and sub-national statistical units, relating rainfed and irrigated crop yields reported in census statistics to simulated ratios of actual to potential crop evapotranspiration for rainfed crops. By restricting water use of irrigated crops to green water only, the potential production loss without any irrigation was computed. For the period 1998–2002, the global value of total crop water use was 6685km3yr−1, of which blue water use was 1180km3yr−1, green water use of irrigated crops was 919km3yr−1 and green water use of rainfed crops was 4586km3yr−1. Total crop water use was largest for rice (941km3yr−1), wheat (858km3yr−1) and maize (722km3yr−1). The largest amounts of blue water were used for rice (307km3yr−1) and wheat (208km3yr−1). Blue water use as percentage of total crop water use was highest for date palms (85\%), cotton (39\%), citrus fruits (33\%), rice (33\%) and sugar beets (32\%), while for cassava, oil palm and cocoa, almost no blue water was used. Average crop yield of irrigated cereals was 442Mgkm−2 while average yield of rainfed cereals was only 266Mgkm−2. Average virtual water content of cereal crops was 1109m3Mg−1 of green water and 291m3Mg−1 of blue water, while average crop water productivity of cereal crops was 714gm−3. If currently irrigated crops were not irrigated, global production of dates, rice, cotton, citrus and sugar cane would decrease by 60\%, 39\%, 38\%, 32\% and 31\%, respectively. Forty-three per cent of cereal production was on irrigated land, and without irrigation, cereal production on irrigated land would decrease by 47\%, corresponding to a 20\% loss of total cereal production. The largest cereal production losses would occur in Northern Africa (66\%) and Southern Asia (45\%) while losses would be very low for Northern Europe (0.001\%), Western Europe (1.2\%), Eastern Europe (1.5\%) and Middle Africa (1.6\%). Uncertainties and limitations are discussed in the manuscript, and a comparison of GCWM results to statistics or results of other studies shows good agreement at the regional scale, but larger differences for specific countries.},

We demonstrate a clear mechanism that the resulting increase in evapotranspiration and water vapor export significantly impacts the atmospheric circulation in the southwestern United States, including strengthening the regional hydrological cycle. We also identify that irrigation in the Central Valley initiates a previously unknown, anthropogenic loop in the regional hydrological cycle, in which summer precipitation is increased by 15\%, causing a corresponding increase in Colorado River streamflow of 30\%. Ultimately, some of this additional streamflow is returned to California via managed diversions through the Colorado River aqueduct and the All-American Canal.},

	abstract = {Irrigation is the single largest anthropogenic water use, a modification of the land surface that significantly affects surface energy budgets, the water cycle, and climate. Irrigation, however, is typically not included in standard historical general circulation model (GCM) simulations along with other anthropogenic and natural forcings. To investigate the importance of irrigation as an anthropogenic climate forcing, we conduct two 5-member ensemble GCM experiments. Both are setup identical to the historical forced (anthropogenic plus natural) scenario used in version 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, but in one experiment we also add water to the land surface using a dataset of historically estimated irrigation rates. Irrigation has a negligible effect on the global average radiative balance at the top of the atmosphere, but causes significant cooling of global average surface air temperatures over land and dampens regional warming trends. This cooling is regionally focused and is especially strong in Western North America, the Mediterranean, the Middle East, and Asia. Irrigation enhances cloud cover and precipitation in these same regions, except for summer in parts of Monsoon Asia, where irrigation causes a reduction in monsoon season precipitation. Irrigation cools the surface, reducing upward fluxes of longwave radiation (increasing net longwave), and increases cloud cover, enhancing shortwave reflection (reducing net shortwave). The relative magnitude of these two processes causes regional increases (northern India) or decreases (Central Asia, China) in energy availability at the surface and top of the atmosphere. Despite these changes in net radiation, however, climate responses are due primarily to larger magnitude shifts in the Bowen ratio from sensible to latent heating. Irrigation impacts on temperature, precipitation, and other climate variables are regionally significant, even while other anthropogenic forcings (anthropogenic aerosols, greenhouse gases, etc.) dominate the long term climate evolution in the simulations. To better constrain the magnitude and uncertainties of irrigation-forced climate anomalies, irrigation should therefore be considered as another important anthropogenic climate forcing in the next generation of historical climate simulations and multi-model assessments.},

While the extent of irrigation and related water uses are reported in statistical databases or estimated by model simulations, information on the source of irrigation water is scarce and very scattered. Here we present a new global inventory on the extent of areas irrigated with groundwater, surface water or non-conventional sources, and we determine the related consumptive water uses. The inventory provides data for 15 038 national and sub-national administrative units. Irrigated area was provided by census-based statistics from international and national organizations. A global model was then applied to simulate consumptive water uses for irrigation by water source. Globally, area equipped for irrigation is currently about 301 million ha of which 38\% are equipped for irrigation with groundwater. Total consumptive groundwater use for irrigation is estimated as 545 km3 yr−1, or 43\% of the total consumptive irrigation water use of 1277 km3 yr−1. The countries with the largest extent of areas equipped for irrigation with groundwater, in absolute terms, are India (39 million ha), China (19 million ha) and the USA (17 million ha). Groundwater use in irrigation is increasing both in absolute terms and in percentage of total irrigation, leading in places to concentrations of users exploiting groundwater storage at rates above groundwater recharge. Despite the uncertainties associated with statistical data available to track patterns and growth of groundwater use for irrigation, the inventory presented here is a major step towards a more informed assessment of agricultural water use and its consequences for the global water cycle.},

However, because the water cycle is embodied in the climate system, irrigation has a more complex influence on climate. We also simulate a change in the temperature vertical profile and a large surface cooling of up to 0.8 K over irrigated land areas. This is of opposite sign than expected from the radiative forcing alone, and this questions the applicability of the radiative forcing concept for such a climatic perturbation.

Therefore, knowledge of the extent of irrigated land is important for hydrological and crop modelling, global change research, and assessments of resource use and management. Information on the historical evolution of irrigated lands is limited. The new global historical irrigation data set (HID) provides estimates of the temporal development of the area equipped for irrigation (AEI) between 1900 and 2005 at 5 arcmin resolution. We collected sub-national irrigation statistics from various sources and found that the global extent of AEI increased from 63 million ha (Mha) in 1900 to 111 Mha in 1950 and 306 Mha in 2005. We developed eight gridded versions of time series of AEI by combining sub-national irrigation statistics with different data sets on the historical extent of cropland and pasture. Different rules were applied to maximize consistency of the gridded products to sub-national irrigation statistics or to historical cropland and pasture data sets. The HID reflects very well the spatial patterns of irrigated land as shown on historical maps for the western United States (around year 1900) and on a global map (around year 1960). Mean aridity on irrigated land increased and mean natural river discharge on irrigated land decreased from 1900 to 1950 whereas aridity decreased and river discharge remained approximately constant from 1950 to 2005.

The equilibrium climate sensitivity and transient climate response have both increased from the previous climate model IPSL-CM5A-LR used in CMIP5.

Here we evaluate the realism of simulated evapotranspiration (ET), precipitation, and temperature in the CMIP5 multimodel ensemble on continental areas. For ET, a newly compiled synthesis data set prepared within the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment-sponsored LandFlux-EVAL project is used. The results reveal systematic ET biases in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) simulations, with an overestimation in most regions, especially in Europe, Africa, China, Australia, Western North America, and part of the Amazon region. The global average overestimation amounts to 0.17 mm/d. This bias is more pronounced than in the previous CMIP3 ensemble (overestimation of 0.09 mm/d). Consistent with the ET overestimation, precipitation is also overestimated relative to existing reference data sets. We suggest that the identified biases in ET can explain respective systematic biases in temperature in many of the considered regions. The biases additionally display a seasonal dependence and are generally of opposite sign (ET underestimation and temperature overestimation) in boreal summer (June–August).},

A warm period positive temperature dependent bias is identified for many of the models within many of the chosen climate regions. However, the exact temperature dependence varies considerably between the models. We analyse the role of this difference as a contributing factor for some models to project stronger regional warming than others by looking at the entire ensemble rather than individual models. RCP4.5 temperature projections from all GCMs for two time periods (2021–2050 and 2071–2100) are compared against a linear fit to the 50\% warmest months from the respective q-q plot for each model and region. Taken together, we find that in general models with a positive temperature dependent bias tend to have a large projected temperature change, and these tendencies increase with increasing global warming level. We argue that this appears to be linked with the ability of models to capture complex feedbacks accurately. In particular land-surface atmosphere interactions are treated differently and with different degree of realism between models.},

These processes are to a large extent associated with soil moisture (SM). This study investigates the role of soil moisture–atmosphere coupling for the European summer climate over the period 1959–2006 using simulations with a regional climate model. The focus of this study is set on temperature and precipitation extremes and trends. The analysis is based on simulations performed with the regional climate model CLM, driven with ECMWF reanalysis and operational analysis data. The set of experiments consists of a control simulation (CTL) with interactive SM, and sensitivity experiments with prescribed SM: a dry and a wet run to determine the impact of extreme values of SM, as well as experiments with lowpass-filtered SM from CTL to quantify the impact of the temporal variability of SM on different time scales. Soil moisture–climate interactions are found to have significant effects on temperature extremes in the experiments, and impacts on precipitation extremes are also identified. Case studies of selected major summer heat waves reveal that the intraseasonal and interannual variability of SM account for 5–30\% and 10–40\% of the simulated heat wave anomaly, respectively. For extreme precipitation events on the other hand, only the wet-day frequency is impacted in the experiments with prescribed soil moisture. Simulated trends for the past decades, which appear consistent with projected changes for the 21st century, are identified to be at least partly linked to SM-atmosphere feedbacks.},

Therefore, a better representation of this variable in the Land-Surface Models (LSMs) used in climate modelling could significantly reduce the uncertainties associated with future climate predictions. In this study, the ESA-CCI soil moisture (SM) combined product (v4.2) has been confronted to the simulated top-first layers/cms of the ORCHIDEE LSM (the continental part of the IPSL Earth System Model) for the years 2008-2016, to evaluate its potential to improve the model using data assimilation techniques. The ESA-CCI data are first rescaled to match the climatology of the model and the signal representative depth is selected. Results are found to be relatively consistent over the first 20 cm of the model. Strong correlations found between the model and the ESA-CCI product show that ORCHIDEE can adequately reproduce the observed SM dynamics. As well as considering two different atmospheric forcings to drive the model, we consider two different model parameterizations related to the soil resistance to evaporation. The correlation metric is shown to be more sensitive to the choice of meteorological forcing than to the choice of model parameterization. Therefore, the metric is not optimal in highlighting structural deficiencies in the model. In contrast, the temporal autocorrelation metric is shown to be more sensitive to this model parameterization, making the metric a potential candidate for future data assimilation experiments.},

It determines, for example, the water availability for vegetation, the occurrences of droughts, and the surface heat exchanges. As such, surface soil moisture (SSM) “drydowns,” i.e., the SSM temporal dynamics following a significant rainfall event, are of particular interest when evaluating and calibrating land surface models (LSMs). By investigating drydowns, characterized by an exponential decay time scale τ, we aim to improve the representation of SSM in the ORCHIDEE global LSM. We consider τ calculated over 18 International Soil Moisture Network sites found within the footprint of FLUXNET towers, covering different vegetation types and climates. Using the ORCHIDEE LSM, we compare τ from the modeled SSM time series to values computed from in situ SSM measurements. We then assess the potential of using τ observations to constrain some water, carbon, and energy parameters of ORCHIDEE, selected using a sensitivity analysis, through a standard Bayesian optimization procedure. The impact of the SSM optimization is evaluated using FLUXNET evapotranspiration and gross primary production (GPP) data. We find that the relative drydowns of SSM can be well calibrated using observation-based τ estimates, when there is no need to match the absolute observed and modeled SSM values. When evaluated using independent data, τ-calibration parameters were able to improve drydowns for 73\% of the sites. Furthermore, the fit of the model to independent fluxes was only minutely changed. We conclude by considering the potential of global satellite products to scale up the experiment to a global-scale optimization.},

Over large tropical rivers basins, model results without the transfer scheme provide significantly smaller amplitudes of water storage than observed by GRACE. Including the transfer scheme that accounts for water stored in the river systems and aquifers during its transfer to the oceans leads to predicted land water storage that are comparable to GRACE observations.

	abstract = {Large-scale runoff routing models (RRMs) are important as a validation tool for GCMs, and to close the hydrological cycle in fully-coupled climate models. The model RiTHM was developed to simulate the discharge of large rivers from the total runoff simulated by the LMD GCM. It uses a 1024×800 grid, nested in the 64×50 grid of the LMD GCM. The runoff simulated in a GCM grid cell is uniformly distributed over the underlying cells, where a series of two reservoirs accounts for the delay related to infiltration through the unsaturated zone and aquifers. The resulting riverflow is routed assuming pure translation along the drainage network, extracted with a GIS from a 5 min DEM. The transfer time from a cell to the outlet depends on topography, and on a basin-wide parameter, the time of concentration. RiTHM was calibrated in 11 river basins, using a realistic runoff forcing (computed by the land surface model SECHIBA from reanalyzed meteorological forcing). This led to a very satisfactory reproduction of observed hydrographs. The main problems were related to hydraulic processes neglected in RiTHM (reservoirs, diversion of riverflow because of flooding or irrigation). These results helped to validate SECHIBA, except for its snow processes, shown to be too simple. With the same parameters, RiTHM was also forced with runoff from the LMD GCM. This induced an important degradation of the simulated hydrographs, regarding both volume and timing. It was largely explained by errors in precipitation, and more generally climate, in the GCM. The direct calibration of RiTHM under the GCM-runoff forcing markedly improved the timing of simulated discharge, which could be interesting for land–atmosphere–ocean coupling. This work demonstrated that the usefulness of RRMs for GCMs strongly depends on their adequate calibration.},

	abstract = {The high-latitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere are a nexus for the interaction between land surface physical properties and their exchange of carbon and energy with the atmosphere. At these latitudes, two carbon pools of planetary significance – those of the permanently frozen soils (permafrost), and of the great expanse of boreal forest – are vulnerable to destabilization in the face of currently observed climatic warming, the speed and intensity of which are expected to increase with time. Improved projections of future Arctic and boreal ecosystem transformation require improved land surface models that integrate processes specific to these cold biomes. To this end, this study lays out relevant new parameterizations in the ORCHIDEE-MICT land surface model. These describe the interactions between soil carbon, soil temperature and hydrology, and their resulting feedbacks on water and CO2 fluxes, in addition to a recently developed fire module. Outputs from ORCHIDEE-MICT, when forced by two climate input datasets, are extensively evaluated against (i) temperature gradients between the atmosphere and deep soils, (ii) the hydrological components comprising the water balance of the largest high-latitude basins, and (iii) CO2 flux and carbon stock observations. The model performance is good with respect to empirical data, despite a simulated excessive plant water stress and a positive land surface temperature bias. In addition, acute model sensitivity to the choice of input forcing data suggests that the calibration of model parameters is strongly forcing-dependent. Overall, we suggest that this new model design is at the forefront of current efforts to reliably estimate future perturbations to the high-latitude terrestrial environment.},

The intermediate complexity snow scheme ISBA-ES (Interaction between Soil, Biosphere and Atmosphere-Explicit Snow) that includes key snow processes has been adapted and implemented into ORCHIDEE, referred to here as ORCHIDEE-ES. In this study, the adapted scheme is evaluated against the observations from the alpine site Col de Porte (CDP) with a continuous 18 year data set and from sites distributed in northern Eurasia. At CDP, the comparisons of snow depth, snow water equivalent, surface temperature, snow albedo, and snowmelt runoff reveal that the improved scheme in ORCHIDEE is capable of simulating the internal snow processes better than the original one. Preliminary sensitivity tests indicate that snow albedo parameterization is the main cause for the large difference in snow-related variables but not for soil temperature simulated by the two models. The ability of the ORCHIDEE-ES to better simulate snow thermal conductivity mainly results in differences in soil temperatures. These are confirmed by performing sensitivity analysis of ORCHIDEE-ES parameters using the Morris method. These features can enable us to more realistically investigate interactions between snow and soil thermal regimes (and related soil carbon decomposition). When the two models are compared over sites located in northern Eurasia from 1979 to 1993, snow-related variables and 20 cm soil temperature are better reproduced by ORCHIDEE-ES than ORCHIDEE, revealing a more accurate representation of spatio-temporal variability.},

	abstract = {Limiting global warming to well below 2°C is an imminent challenge for humanity. However, even if this global target can be met, some regions are still likely to experience substantial warming relative to others. Using idealized global climate simulations, we examine the potential of land management options in affecting regional climate, with a focus on crop albedo enhancement and irrigation (climate-effective land management). The implementation is performed over all crop regions globally to provide an upper bound. We find that the implementation of both crop albedo enhancement and irrigation can reduce hot temperature extremes by more than 2°C in North America, Eurasia, and India over the 21st century relative to a scenario without management application. The efficacy of crop albedo enhancement scales with the magnitude, where a cooling response exceeding 0.5°C for hot temperature extremes was achieved with a large (i.e., ≥0.08) change in crop albedo. Regional differences were attributed to the surface energy balance response with temperature changes mostly explained by latent heat flux changes for irrigation and net shortwave radiation changes for crop albedo enhancement. However, limitations do exist, where we identify warming over the winter months when climate-effective land management is temporarily suspended. This was associated with persistent cloud cover that enhances longwave warming. It cannot be confirmed if the magnitude of this feedback is reproducible in other climate models. Our results overall demonstrate that regional warming of hot extremes in our climate model can be partially mitigated when using an idealized treatment of climate-effective land management.},

	abstract = {Global soil water availability is challenged by the effects of climate change and a growing population. On average, 70 \% of freshwater extraction is attributed to agriculture, and the demand is increasing. In this study, the effects of climate change on the evolution of the irrigation water requirement to sustain current crop productivity are assessed by using the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) crop growth model AquaCrop version 6.1. The model is run at 0.5∘lat×0.5∘long resolution over the European mainland, assuming a general C3-type of crop, and forced by climate input data from the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project phase three (ISIMIP3).

 First, the AquaCrop surface soil moisture (SSM) forced with two types of ISIMIP3 historical meteorological datasets is evaluated with satellite-based SSM estimates in two ways. When driven by ISIMIP3a reanalysis meteorology, daily simulated SSM values have an unbiased root mean square difference of 0.08 and 0.06 m3 m−3, with SSM retrievals from the Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) missions, respectively, for the years 2015–2016 (2016 is the end year of the reanalysis data). When forced with ISIMIP3b meteorology from five global climate models (GCMs) for the years 2015–2020, the historical simulated SSM climatology closely agrees with the satellite-based SSM climatologies.

 Second, the evaluated AquaCrop model is run to quantify the future irrigation requirement, for an ensemble of five GCMs and three different emission scenarios. The simulated net irrigation requirement (Inet) of the three summer months for a near and far future climate period (2031–2060 and 2071–2100) is compared to the baseline period of 1985–2014 to assess changes in the mean and interannual variability of the irrigation demand. Averaged over the continent and the model ensemble, the far future Inet is expected to increase by 22 mm per month (+30 \%) under a high-emission scenario Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) 3–7.0. Central and southern Europe are the most impacted, with larger Inet increases. The interannual variability in Inet is likely to increase in northern and central Europe, whereas the variability is expected to decrease in southern regions. Under a high mitigation scenario (SSP1–2.6), the increase in Inet will stabilize at around 13 mm per month towards the end of the century, and interannual variability will still increase but to a smaller extent. The results emphasize a large uncertainty in the Inet projected by various GCMs.},

	abstract = {Agricultural irrigation is the major water consumer in the Mediterranean region. In response to the growing pressure on freshwater resources, more efficient irrigation technologies have been widely promoted. In this study, we assess the impact of the ongoing transition from flood to drip irrigation on future hydroclimatic regimes under various climate change scenarios, with a particular focus on actual evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge in the Mediterranean region of Valencia, Spain. Hydroclimatic predictions for the near-term future (2020–2049) and the mid-term future (2045–2074) were made under two emission scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) using a hydrological model that was forced with data from five GCM-RCM combinations and field-based irrigation volume and frequency observations. Our findings suggest that climate change could lead to statistically significant changes in the regional hydroclimatic regime despite projection uncertainties. Major changes include a statistically significant decrease in mean groundwater recharge of up to −6.6\% under flood irrigation and −9.3\% under drip irrigation and contrasting changes in mean actual evapotranspiration for flood and drip irrigation in the order of +1\% and −2.1\%, respectively. Since sustainably available water resources in the Valencia region are entirely allocated, the expected changes and associated uncertainties create a challenging context for future water management. Our simulations further indicate that, rather than climate change, the choice of irrigation technique may have a greater impact on actual evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge. Our findings therefore highlight the importance of considering both climate change and irrigation technique when assessing future water resources in irrigated Mediterranean agriculture.},

	abstract = {Traditional general circulation models, or GCMs—that is, three-dimensional dynamical models with unresolved terms represented in equations with tunable parameters—have been a mainstay of climate research for several decades, and some of the pioneering studies have recently been recognized by a Nobel prize in Physics. Yet, there is considerable debate around their continuing role in the future. Frequently mentioned as limitations of GCMs are the structural error and uncertainty across models with different representations of unresolved scales and the fact that the models are tuned to reproduce certain aspects of the observed Earth. We consider these shortcomings in the context of a future generation of models that may address these issues through substantially higher resolution and detail, or through the use of machine learning techniques to match them better to observations, theory, and process models. It is our contention that calibration, far from being a weakness of models, is an essential element in the simulation of complex systems, and contributes to our understanding of their inner workings. Models can be calibrated to reveal both fine-scale detail and the global response to external perturbations. New methods enable us to articulate and improve the connections between the different levels of abstract representation of climate processes, and our understanding resides in an entire hierarchy of models where GCMs will continue to play a central role for the foreseeable future.},

At present over 140 sites are operating on a long-term and continuous basis. Vegetation under study includes temperate conifer and broadleaved (deciduous and evergreen) forests, tropical and boreal forests, crops, grasslands, chaparral, wetlands, and tundra. Sites exist on five continents and their latitudinal distribution ranges from 70°N to 30°S. FLUXNET has several primary functions. First, it provides infrastructure for compiling, archiving, and distributing carbon, water, and energy flux measurement, and meteorological, plant, and soil data to the science community. (Data and site information are available online at the FLUXNET Web site, http://www-eosdis.ornl.gov/FLUXNET/.) Second, the project supports calibration and flux intercomparison activities. This activity ensures that data from the regional networks are intercomparable. And third, FLUXNET supports the synthesis, discussion, and communication of ideas and data by supporting project scientists, workshops, and visiting scientists. The overarching goal is to provide information for validating computations of net primary productivity, evaporation, and energy absorption that are being generated by sensors mounted on the NASA Terra satellite. Data being compiled by FLUXNET are being used to quantify and compare magnitudes and dynamics of annual ecosystem carbon and water balances, to quantify the response of stand-scale carbon dioxide and water vapor flux densities to controlling biotic and abiotic factors, and to validate a hierarchy of soil–plant–atmosphere trace gas exchange models. Findings so far include 1) net CO2 exchange of temperate broadleaved forests increases by about 5.7 g C m−2 day−1 for each additional day that the growing season is extended; 2) the sensitivity of net ecosystem CO2 exchange to sunlight doubles if the sky is cloudy rather than clear; 3) the spectrum of CO2 flux density exhibits peaks at timescales of days, weeks, and years, and a spectral gap exists at the month timescale; 4) the optimal temperature of net CO2 exchange varies with mean summer temperature; and 5) stand age affects carbon dioxide and water vapor flux densities.},

Consensus changes in soil moisture and latent heat fluxes for past-to-present and present-to-future periods are consistent with CMIP3 simulations, showing a general drying trend over land (less soil moisture, less evaporation) over most of the globe, with the notable exception of high northern latitudes during winter. Sensible heat flux and net radiation declined from preindustrial times to current conditions according to the multimodel consensus, mainly due to increasing aerosols, but that trend reverses abruptly in the future projection. No broad trends are found in soil moisture memory except for reductions during boreal winter associated with high-latitude warming and diminution of frozen soils. Land–atmosphere coupling is projected to increase in the future across most of the globe, meaning a greater control by soil moisture variations on surface fluxes and the lower troposphere. There is also a strong consensus for a deepening atmospheric boundary layer and diminished gradients across the entrainment zone at the top of the boundary layer, indicating that the land surface feedback on the atmosphere should become stronger both in absolute terms and relative to the influence of the conditions of the free atmosphere. Coupled with the trend toward greater hydrologic extremes such as severe droughts, the land surface seems likely to play a greater role in amplifying both extremes and trends in climate on subseasonal and longer time scales.},

	abstract = {The main objective of the present work is to study the impacts of water table depth on the near surface climate and the physical mechanisms responsible for these impacts through the analysis of land–atmosphere coupled numerical simulations. The analysis is performed with the LMDZ (standard physics) and ORCHIDEE models, which are the atmosphere-land components of the Institut Pierre Simon Laplace (IPSL) Climate Model. The results of sensitivity experiments with groundwater tables (WT) prescribed at depths of 1 m (WTD1) and 2 m (WTD2) are compared to the results of a reference simulation with free drainage from an unsaturated 2 m soil (REF). The response of the atmosphere to the prescribed WT is mostly concentrated over land, and the largest differences in precipitation and evaporation are found between REF and WTD1. Saturating the bottom half of the soil in WTD1 induces a systematic increase of soil moisture across the continents. Evapotranspiration (ET) increases over water-limited regimes due to increased soil moisture, but it decreases over energy-limited regimes due to the decrease in downwelling radiation and the increase in cloud cover. The tropical (25°S–25°N) and mid-latitude areas (25°N–60°N and 25°S–60°S) are significantly impacted by the WT, showing a decrease in air temperature (−0.5 K over mid-latitudes and −1 K over tropics) and an increase in precipitation. The latter can be explained by more vigorous updrafts due to an increased meridional temperature gradient between the equator and higher latitudes, which transports more water vapour upward, causing a positive precipitation change in the ascending branch. Over the West African Monsoon and Australian Monsoon regions, the precipitation changes in both intensity (increases) and location (poleward). The more intense convection and the change of the large-scale dynamics are responsible for this change. Transition zones, such as the Mediterranean area and central North America, are also impacted, with strengthened convection resulting from increased ET.},

	abstract = {Understanding precipitation is essential for quantifying weather and climate-related risks. Changes in precipitation climatology are typically based on independent analysis of precipitation frequency and intensity. Here we show that where it rains more often, it also rains harder. When grouping global precipitation reanalysis data and observations from the past 40 years into regions of similar wet-day frequency, regardless of geographical separation, there is a strong correlation with wet-day intensity distributions. These wet-day-frequency regions are also more physically coherent than regions based on geographical location. We find the coherent relationship between wet-day frequency and intensity distributions is partially explained by wet-day-frequency regions having similar vertical velocity and convective available potential energy distributions, once polar regions are excluded. These represent dynamic and thermodynamic processes that indicate how conducive wet-day-frequency regions are to large-scale and convective precipitation. This suggests that the main drivers of precipitation are universal. We also show that extreme-precipitation metrics are dependent on wet-day frequency within our framework. Our results imply that wet-day frequency could be used to derive estimates of extreme-precipitation climate indices and corresponding uncertainties, these uncertainties being related to local processes.},

	abstract = {Time integration of the parametrized boundary layer vertical diffusion in models of the atmosphere, used in numerical weather prediction (NWP) and climate modelling, can produce noise which appears as twotime-step oscillations in boundary layer tendencies. The origin of this noise was considered by Kalnay and Kanamitsu who analysed a number of schemes, two of which were based on a predictor–corrector approach. Here, a generalization of these two schemes is presented which results in unconditional stability for practical NWP vertical diffusion problems. The proposed generalization improves the stability of the original schemes. Asymptotic error analysis shows that this improvement is achieved without loss of accuracy, and that a small reduction in the leading error term is possible. Second-order accuracy is feasible but in this case unconditional stability can be achieved only for linear or mildly nonlinear problems. Numerical experiments and model simulations support the analysis presented in this paper. The limitations and strengths of the scheme are exposed and suggestions for a practical implementation are made. This scheme is ideally suited as a component of a more general predictor–corrector algorithm for the problem of physics–dynamics coupling, for example that of Cullen and Salmond.},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to propose a general interface for coupling general circulation models (GCMs) to land surface schemes (LSS) in order to achieve a plug compatibility between these complex models. As surface parameterizations include more processes, they have moved from being subroutines of GCMs to independent schemes which can also be applied for other purposes. This evolution has raised the problem within climate modeling groups of coupling these schemes to GCMs in a simple and flexible way. As LSS reaches a larger independence, a general interface is needed to enable exchange within the community. This paper discusses the tasks LSS have to fulfill when coupled to a GCM after a review of the current state of the art and the likely future evolutions of both components. The numerical schemes used for the processes which couple the land surfaces to the atmosphere are reviewed to ensure that the interface can be applied to all LSS and GCMs after only minor changes.},

The seasonal abrupt change in the CR is attributed to the sudden reversed water vapor transport with the winter and summer monsoon and the wheat/maize rotation with irrigation in the winter wheat season.

Results from 16 CMIP models show coherent patterns of change in the AI/SM phase space that are aligned with the established soil-moisture/evapotranspiration regimes. We introduce an active-rain regime as a special case of the energy-limited regime. Rainfall shifts toward larger rain totals in this active-rain regime, with less rain on other days, resulting in an overall SM reduction. Consequently, the regimes where SM constrains evapotranspiration become more frequently occupied, and corresponding hydroclimatic changes align with the position of the critical SM value in the AI/SM phase space.},

Advances in our understanding are hampered by discipline barriers and challenges in understanding the role of small spatiotemporal scales. In this perspective, we propose to study the atmosphere–ecosystem interaction as a continuum by integrating leaf to regional scales (multiscale) and integrating biochemical and physical processes (multiprocesses). The challenges ahead are (1) How do clouds and canopies affect the transferring and in-canopy penetration of radiation, thereby impacting photosynthesis and biogenic chemical transformations? (2) How is the radiative energy spatially distributed and converted into turbulent fluxes of heat, moisture, carbon, and reactive compounds? (3) How do local (leaf-canopy-clouds, 1 m to kilometers) biochemical and physical processes interact with regional meteorology and atmospheric composition (kilometers to 100 km)? (4) How can we integrate the feedbacks between cloud radiative effects and plant physiology to reduce uncertainties in our climate projections driven by regional warming and enhanced carbon dioxide levels? Our methodology integrates fine-scale explicit simulations with new observational techniques to determine the role of unresolved small-scale spatiotemporal processes in weather and climate models.},

	abstract = {One of the most significant signals in the thermometer-observed temperature record since 1900 is the decrease in the diurnal temperature range over land, largely due to rising of the minimum temperatures. Generally, climate models have not well replicated this change in diurnal temperature range. Thus, the cause for night-time warming in the observed temperatures has been attributed to a variety of external causes. We take an alternative approach to examine the role that the internal dynamics of the stable nocturnal boundary layer (SNBL) may play in affecting the response and sensitivity of minimum temperatures to added downward longwave forcing. As indicated by previous nonlinear analyses of a truncated two-layer equation system, the SNBL can be very sensitive to changes in greenhouse gas forcing, surface roughness, heat capacity, and wind speed. A new single-column model growing out of these nonlinear studies is used to examine the SNBL. Specifically, budget analyses of the model are provided that evaluate the response of the boundary layer to forcing and sensitivity to mixing formulations. Based on these model analyses, it is likely that part of the observed long-term increase in minimum temperature is reflecting a redistribution of heat by changes in turbulence and not by an accumulation of heat in the boundary layer. Because of the sensitivity of the shelter level temperature to parameters and forcing, especially to uncertain turbulence parameterization in the SNBL, there should be caution about the use of minimum temperatures as a diagnostic global warming metric in either observations or models.},

	abstract = {Abstract A formulation to include prognostic atmospheric layers in offline surface schemes is derived from atmospheric equations. Whereas multilayer schemes developed previously need a complex coupling between atmospheric-model levels and surface-scheme levels, the coupling proposed here remains simple. This is possible because the atmospheric layers interacting with the surface scheme are independent of the atmospheric model that could be coupled above. The surface boundary layer (SBL; both inside and just above the canopy) is resolved prognostically, taking into account large-scale forcing, turbulence, and, if any, drag and canopy forces and surface fluxes. This formulation allows one to retrieve the logarithmic law in neutral conditions, and it has been validated when coupled to a 3D atmospheric model. Systematic comparisons with 2-m observations and 10-m wind have been made for 2 months. The SBL scheme is able to model the 2-m temperature accurately, as well as the 10-m wind, without any use of analytical interpolation. The largest improvement takes place during stable conditions (i.e., by night), during which analytical laws and interpolation methods are known to be less accurate, and in mountainous areas, in which nocturnal low-level flow is strongly influenced by surface cooling. The prognostic SBL scheme is shown to solve the nighttime physical disconnection problem between surface and atmosphere models. The inclusion of the SBL into the urban Town Energy Balance scheme is presented in a paper by Hamdi and Masson in which the ability of the method to simulate the profiles of both mean and turbulent quantities from above the building down to the road surface is shown using data from the Basel Urban Boundary Layer Experiment (BUBBLE). The proposed method will allow the inclusion of the detailed physics of the multilayer schemes (e.g., the interactions of the SBL flow with forest or urban canopy) into a single-layer scheme that is easily coupled with atmospheric models.},

	abstract = {Abstract The collapse of turbulence in the nocturnal boundary layer is studied by means of a simple bulk model that describes the basic physical interactions in the surface energy balance. It is shown that for a given mechanical forcing, the amount of turbulent heat that can be transported downward is limited to a certain maximum. In the case of weak winds and clear skies, this maximum can be significantly smaller than the net radiative loss minus soil heat transport. In the case when the surface has low heat capacity, this imbalance generates rapid surface cooling that further suppresses the turbulent heat transport, so that eventually turbulence largely ceases (positive feedback mechanism). The model predicts the minimum wind speed for sustainable turbulence for the so-called crossing level. At this level, some decameters above the surface, the wind is relatively stationary compared to lower and higher levels. The critical speed is predicted in the range of about 5–7 m s−1, depending on radiative forcing and surface properties, and is in agreement with observations at Cabauw. The critical value appears not very sensitive to model details or to the exact values of the input parameters. Finally, results are interpreted in terms of external forcings, such as geostrophic wind. As it is generally larger than the speed at crossing height, a 5 m s−1 geostrophic wind may be considered as the typical limit below which sustainable, continuous turbulence under clear-sky conditions is unlikely to exist. Below this threshold emergence of the very stable nocturnal boundary layer is anticipated.},

	abstract = {A simple parameterization of the hydrologie exchanges between the soil–vegetation system and the atmosphere (SECHIBA) has been developed for use within atmospheric general circulation models (AGCM). For each grid box of the model, eight land surface types (bare soil plus seven vegetation classes) are defined, each of them covering a fractional area of the grid box and allowed to be found simultaneously. Over each of these covers the transfers are computed: evaporation from soil, transpiration from plants through a resistance defined by the concepts of stomatal resistance and architectural resistance, and interception loss from the water reservoir over the canopy. These fluxes are then averaged over the grid box to derive the total amount of water vapor that is transferred to the first atmospheric level of the AGCM. Parameterization of soil water allows for the moistening of an upper layer, of variable depth, during a rainfall event. This new scheme is quite simple and requires prescription of a restricted number of parameters: seven for each class of vegetation and four for the soil. Nevertheless, it is demonstrated that the latent heat fluxes it simulates are quite comparable to the ones simulated by the Biosphere–Atmosphere Transfer Scheme or calculated by Shuttleworth over the tropical rainforest of the Reserva Ducke (Amazon), with no tuning involved.},

	abstract = {In the 1990s, scientists at European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) suggested that artificially enhancing turbulent diffusion in stable conditions improves the representation of two important aspects of weather forecasts, i.e., near-surface temperatures and synoptic cyclones. Since then, this practice has often been used for tuning the large-scale performance of operational numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, although it is widely recognized to be detrimental for an accurate representation of stable boundary layers. Here we investigate why, 20 years on, such a compromise is still needed in the ECMWF model. We find that reduced turbulent diffusion in stable conditions improves the representation of winds in stable boundary layers, but it deteriorates the large-scale flow and the near-surface temperatures. This suggests that enhanced diffusion is still needed to compensate for errors caused by other poorly represented processes. Among these, we identify the orographic drag, which influences the large-scale flow in a similar way to the turbulence closure for stable conditions, and the strength of the land-atmosphere coupling, which partially controls the near-surface temperatures. We also take a closer look at the relationship between the turbulence closure in stable conditions and the large-scale flow, which was not investigated in detail with a global NWP model. We demonstrate that the turbulent diffusion in stable conditions affects the large-scale flow by modulating not only the strength of synoptic cyclones and anticyclones, but also the amplitude of the planetary-scale standing waves.},

	abstract = {An evaluation of the Biosphere–Atmosphere Transfer Scheme (BATS) snow submodel was conducted, both in a stand-alone mode and within the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Climate Model version 3 (CCM3). We evaluated, in the stand-alone mode, the performance of BATS parameterizations at local scales using ground-based observations from the former Soviet Union and from Mammoth Mountain, California. The BATS snow scheme reproduces well the seasonal evolution of snow water equivalent in both sites, and the results for the Mammoth Mountain site compare well with those from a more complex, physically based model (SNTHERM). In the coupled mode, we evaluated the modelled snow cover extent, snow mass, precipitation and temperature from BATS as linked to the NCAR CCM3 using available observations. The coupled models capture the broad pattern of seasonal and geographical distribution of snow cover, with better overall performance than the passive microwave snow data derived from the Nimbus-7 Scanning Multi-channel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) which generally underestimates snow depth. In terms of continents, the snow mass is better simulated during the accumulation period than during the melt period, which is the case for both North America and Eurasia. The simulation of snow mass, precipitation and air temperature for North America is slightly better than that for Eurasia. A rigorous evaluation of snow simulations in coupled land–atmosphere models requires high quality global datasets of snow cover extent, snow depth and snow water equivalent. The available datasets and model outputs are not yet ready to fulfil this objective. Copyright © 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

In this paper the authors examine the simulation of snow. In comparison with observations, the models are able to capture the broad features of the snow regime on both an intra- and interannual basis. However, weaknesses in the simulations exist, and early season ablation events are a significant source of model scatter. Over the 18-yr simulation, systematic differences between the models’ snow simulations are evident and reveal specific aspects of snow model parameterization and design as being responsible. Vapor exchange at the snow surface varies widely among the models, ranging from a large net loss to a small net source for the snow season. Snow albedo, fractional snow cover, and their interplay have a large effect on energy available for ablation, with differences among models most evident at low snow depths. The incorporation of the snowpack within an LSS structure affects the method by which snow accesses, as well as utilizes, available energy for ablation. The sensitivity of some models to longwave radiation, the dominant winter radiative flux, is partly due to a stability-induced feedback and the differing abilities of models to exchange turbulent energy with the atmosphere. Results presented in this paper suggest where weaknesses in macroscale snow modeling lie and where both theoretical and observational work should be focused to address these weaknesses.},

	abstract = {The Russian drifting station North Pole 4 (NP-4) was within 5° latitude of the North Pole from April 1956 to April 1957. We use a wide-ranging set of snow and meteorological data collected at 3-hourly intervals on NP-4 during this period to investigate energy and mass transfer in the snow, sea ice, and atmospheric surface layer in the central Arctic. SNTHERM, a one-dimensional energy and mass balance model, synthesizes these diverse NP-4 data and thereby yields energetically consistent time series of the components of the surface heat budget. To parameterize the sensible heat flux during extremely stable stratification, we replace the usual log-linear stability function with the “Dutch” formulation and introduce a windless coefficient in the bulk parameterization. This coefficient provides sensible heat transfer at the surface, even when the mean wind speed is near zero, and thereby prevents the surface temperature from falling to unrealistically low values, a common modeling problem when the stratification is very stable. Several other modifications to SNTHERM introduce procedures for creating a realistic snowpack that has continuously variable density and is subject to erosion and wind packing. The NP-4 data provide for two distinct simulations: one on 2-year ice and one on multiyear ice. We validate our modeling by comparing simulated and observed temperatures at various depths in the snow and sea ice. Simulations for both sites show the same tendencies. During the summer, the shortwave radiation is the main term in the surface heat budget. Shortwave radiation also penetrates into the snow and causes a subsurface temperature maximum that both the data and the model capture. During the winter, the net longwave balance is the main term in the surface heat budget. The snow and sea ice cool in response to longwave losses, but the flux of sensible heat from the air to the surface mitigates these losses and is thus nearly a mirror image of the emitted longwave flux.},

Modifications are implemented in the parameterization of snow sublimation, albedo ageing, surface runoff, and soil hydraulical coefficients. Results of a third run, SECMWF, in which the snow changes were incorporated but the runoff and soil changes were not, were also included in the analysis. Comparison of the model results to observed catchment averaged discharge and the hydrological balance inferred from it showed a pronounced improvement of the annually averaged partitioning of precipitation over evaporation and runoff. The changes were mainly a result of a reduced snow sublimation by an increased aerodynamical resistance. Comparison to measured discharge from individual calibration basins revealed that the surface runoff parameterization resulted in improved temporal dynamics of discharge from the mountainous Abisko catchment, but it deteriorated results from the low Lansjärve basin. This was not only due to a miscalibration of the surface runoff parameterization, but probably requires an appropriate estimation of deep bottom drainage. Local calibration of soil hydrology appears mandatory for obtaining a better temporal characterization of discharge. For the basin simulations considered, annual averaged runoff is fairly insensitive to the partitioning of runoff over a surface component and a deep drainage term.},

	abstract = {The 1993 to 1996 version of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts model had a pronounced near-surface cold bias in winter over continental areas. the problem is illustrated in detail with help of tower observations. It is shown that a positive feedback exists in the land surface boundary-layer coupling that has the potential to amplify model biases. If the surface is cooled too much the boundary layer becomes too stable, reducing the downward heat flux and making the surface even colder. This positive feedback is believed to be stronger in the model than in the real atmosphere, resulting in diurnal temperature cycles that are too large and in excessive soil cooling on a seasonal time-scale in winter. An important contributor to the excessive winter cooling turns out to be the lack of soil moisture freezing in the model. the importance of this process is obvious from soil temperature observations. the seasonal soil temperature evolution shows a clear ‘barrier’ at 0°C due to the thermal inertia of freezing and thawing. A more quantitative illustration is the result of a simple calculation. This shows that the amount of energy necessary to freeze/thaw 1 m3 of wet soil, would cool/warm this soil by about 50 K if the phase transition was not taken into account. To reduce the winter cold bias in the model, three model changes have been tested and are described: (i) the introduction of the process of soil moisture freezing; (ii) revised stability functions to increase the turbulent diffusion of heat in stable situations; and (iii) an increase of the skin-layer conductivity. the effect of these changes on the seasonal evolution of soil and 2 m temperatures is investigated with long runs that have terms that relax towards the operational analysis above the boundary layer. In this way the impact can be studied on the temperature forecasts for the winter of 1995/1996, during which the operational model showed considerable soil temperature drift over Europe. Also, short periods of data assimilation (including 10-day forecasts) have been carried out to study the diurnal time-scales and the impact on model performance. The model changes eliminate to a large extent the systematic 2 m temperature biases for the winter of 1995/1996 over Europe and make the soil temperature evolution much more realistic. the soil moisture freezing, in particular, plays a crucial role by introducing thermal inertia near the freezing point, thereby reducing the annual temperature cycle in the soil. the process of soil moisture freezing leads to a considerable warming of the model's near-surface winter climate over continental areas.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the impact of changes in aerodynamic roughness length for snow-covered surfaces in a land-surface scheme (LSS) on simulated runoff and evapotranspiration. The study was undertaken as the LSS in question produced widely divergent results in runoff, depending on whether it was used in uncoupled one-dimensional simulations forced by observations from the PILPS2e project, or in three-dimensional simulations coupled to an atmospheric model. The LSS was applied in two versions (LSS1 and LSS2) for both uncoupled and coupled simulations, where the only difference between the two versions was in the roughness length of latent heat used over snow-covered surfaces. The results show that feedback mechanisms in temperature and humidity in the coupled simulations were able to compensate for deficiencies in parameterizations and therefore, LSS1 and LSS2 yielded similar runoff results in this case. Since such feedback mechanisms are absent in uncoupled simulations, the two LSS versions produced very different runoff results in the uncoupled case. However, the magnitude of these feedback mechanisms is small compared to normal variability in temperature and humidity and cannot, by themselves, reveal any deficiencies in a parameterization. The conclusion we obtained is that the magnitude of the aerodynamic resistance is important to correctly simulate fluxes and runoff, but feedback mechanisms in a coupled model can partly compensate for errors.},

To help further explain the relationship between snow cover, turbulent exchanges and runoff production, a simple equivalent model (SEM) was devised to reproduce the seasonal and annual fluxes simulated by 13 LSSs that participated in PILPS Phase 2(e). The design of the SEM relates the annual partitioning of precipitation and energy in the LSSs to three primary parameters: snow albedo, effective aerodynamic resistance and evaporation efficiency. Isolation of each of the parameters showed that the annual runoff production was most sensitive to the aerodynamic resistance. The SEM was somewhat successful in reproducing the observed LSS response to a decrease in shortwave radiation and changes in wind speed forcings. SEM parameters derived from the reduced shortwave forcings suggested that increased winter stability suppressed turbulent heat fluxes over snow. Because winter sensible heat fluxes were largely negative, reductions in winter shortwave radiation resulted in an increase in annual average sensible heat.},

	abstract = {Model results from 21 land-surface schemes (LSSs) designed for use in numerical weather prediction and climate models are compared with each other and with observations in the context of the Project for Intercomparison of Land-surface Parameterization Schemes (PILPS) Phase 2(e) model intercomparison experiment. This experiment focuses on simulations of land-surface water and energy fluxes in the 58,000-km2 Torne and Kalix river systems in northern Scandinavia, during the period 1989–1998. All models participating in PILPS Phase 2(e) capture the broad dynamics of snowmelt and runoff, but large differences in snow accumulation and ablation, turbulent heat fluxes, and streamflow exist. The greatest among-model differences in energy and moisture fluxes in these high-latitude environments occur during the spring snowmelt period, reflecting different model parameterizations of snow processes. Differences in net radiation are governed by differences in the simulated radiative surface temperature during the winter months and by differences in surface albedo during the spring/early summer. Differences in net radiation are smallest during the late summer when snow is absent. Although simulated snow sublimation is small for most models, a few models show annual snow sublimation of about 100 mm. These differences in snow sublimation appear to be largely dependent on differences in snow surface roughness parameterizations. The models with high sublimation generally lose their snowpacks too early compared to observations and underpredict the annual runoff. Differences in runoff parameterizations are reflected in differences in daily runoff statistics. Although most models show a greater variability in daily streamflow than the observations, the models with the greatest variability (as much as double the observed variability), produce most of their runoff through fast response, surface runoff mechanisms. As a group, those models that took advantage of an opportunity to calibrate to selected small catchments and to transfer calibration results to the basin at large had a smaller bias and root mean squared error (RMSE) in daily streamflow simulations compared with the models that did not calibrate.},

	abstract = {Twenty-one land-surface schemes (LSSs) participated in the Project for Intercomparison of Land-surface Parameterizations (PILPS) Phase 2(e) experiment, which used data from the Torne–Kalix Rivers in northern Scandinavia. Atmospheric forcing data (precipitation, air temperature, specific humidity, wind speed, downward shortwave and longwave radiation) for a 20-year period (1979–1998) were provided to the 21 participating modeling groups for 218 1/4° grid cells that represented the study domain. The first decade (1979–1988) of the period was used for model spin-up. The quality of meteorologic forcing variables is of particular concern in high-latitude experiments and the quality of the gridded dataset was assessed to the extent possible. The lack of sub-daily precipitation, underestimation of true precipitation and the necessity to estimate incoming solar radiation were the primary data concerns for this study. The results from two of the three types of runs are analyzed in this, the first of a three-part paper: (1) calibration–validation runs—calibration of model parameters using observed streamflow was allowed for two small catchments (570 and 1300 km2), and parameters were then transferred to two other catchments of roughly similar size (2600 and 1500 km2) to assess the ability of models to represent ungauged areas elsewhere; and 2) reruns—using revised forcing data (to resolve problems with apparent underestimation of solar radiation of approximately 36\%, and certain other problems with surface wind in the original forcing data). Model results for the period 1989–1998 are used to evaluate the performance of the participating land-surface schemes in a context that allows exploration of their ability to capture key processes spatially. In general, the experiment demonstrated that many of the LSSs are able to capture the limitations imposed on annual latent heat by the small net radiation available in this high-latitude environment. Simulated annual average net radiation varied between 16 and 40 W/m2 for the 21 models, and latent heat varied between 18 and 36 W/m2. Among-model differences in winter latent heat due to the treatment of aerodynamic resistance appear to be at least as important as those attributable to the treatment of canopy interception. In many models, the small annual net radiation forced negative sensible heat on average, which varied among the models between −11 and 9 W/m2. Even though the largest evaporation rates occur in the summer (June, July and August), model-predicted snow sublimation in winter has proportionately more influence on differences in annual runoff volume among the models. A calibration experiment for four small sub-catchments of the Torne–Kalix basin showed that model parameters that are typically adjusted during calibration, those that control storage of moisture in the soil column or on the land surface via ponding, influence the seasonal distribution of runoff, but have relatively little impact on annual runoff ratios. Similarly, there was no relationship between annual runoff ratios and the proportion of surface and subsurface discharge for the basin as a whole.},

	abstract = {Abstract The Global Energy and Water Cycle Exchanges (GEWEX) project was created more than 30 years ago within the framework of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP). The aim of this initiative was to address major gaps in our understanding of Earth’s energy and water cycles given a lack of information about the basic fluxes and associated reservoirs of these cycles. GEWEX sought to acquire and set standards for climatological data on variables essential for quantifying water and energy fluxes and for closing budgets at the regional and global scales. In so doing, GEWEX activities led to a greatly improved understanding of processes and our ability to predict them. Such understanding was viewed then, as it remains today, essential for advancing weather and climate prediction from global to regional scales. GEWEX has also demonstrated over time the importance of a wider engagement of different communities and the necessity of international collaboration for making progress on understanding and on the monitoring of the changes in the energy and water cycles under ever increasing human pressures. This paper reflects on the first 30 years of evolution and progress that has occurred within GEWEX. This evolution is presented in terms of three main phases of activity. Progress toward the main goals of GEWEX is highlighted by calling out a few achievements from each phase. A vision of the path forward for the coming decade, including the goals of GEWEX for the future, are also described.},

Disagreement remains on the relative role of climate change and human factors, including water abstractions and land cover change, in driving change in annual streamflow. We construct a very dense network of gauging stations (n = 1,874) from Ireland, the United Kingdom, France, Spain, and Portugal for the period of 1961–2012 to detect and then attribute changes in annual streamflow. Using regression-based techniques, we show that climate (precipitation and atmospheric evaporative demand) explains many of the observed trends in northwest Europe, while for southwest Europe human disturbances better explain both temporal and spatial trends. For the latter, large increases in irrigated areas, agricultural intensification, and natural revegetation of marginal lands are inferred to be the dominant drivers of decreases in streamflow.},

	abstract = {The Hadley Centre climate model version HadAM2 is used to study the sensitivity of modelled Antarctic climate to the parametrization of surface and boundary-layer heat fluxes under stable conditions. Specifically, the impact of changing the dependence of surface exchange coefficients and eddy diffusivities on the Richardson number is investigated. Three alternative parametrizations are implemented; in all of these the exchange coefficients decrease more rapidly with increasing stability than they do in the standard parametrization used in the model. When only the surface flux scheme is replaced by one of these alternatives, cooling is largely restricted to the surface, with some compensating warming occurring at the lowest atmospheric levels, and little change is seen in the low-level wind field over Antarctica. If alternative schemes are implemented both at the surface and in the boundary layer, widespread cooling occurs at the surface and at the lowest one or two atmospheric levels. The increased negative buoyancy thus generated causes significant increases in the speed of katabatic winds blowing down the coastal slopes of Antarctica. Colder and stronger offshore winds lead to increased cooling of the Antarctic coastal waters. In a coupled model, this could impact on the production of sea ice and ocean-bottom water. The modelled temperature changes appear to show both a direct response to changed boundary-layer heat-flux divergence and an indirect response as a result of the consequent changes to the low-level circulation.},

Based on the spectral analysis of wind velocity and air temperature fluctuations, it is shown that, when both the gradient Richardson number, Ri, and the flux Richardson number, Rf, exceed a ‘critical value’ of about 0.20–0.25, the inertial subrange associated with the Richardson–Kolmogorov cascade dies out and vertical turbulent fluxes become small. Some small-scale turbulence survives even in this supercritical regime, but this is non-Kolmogorov turbulence, and it decays rapidly with further increasing stability. Similarity theory is based on the turbulent fluxes in the high-frequency part of the spectra that are associated with energy-containing/flux-carrying eddies. Spectral densities in this high-frequency band diminish as the Richardson–Kolmogorov energy cascade weakens; therefore, the applicability of local Monin–Obukhov similarity theory in stable conditions is limited by the inequalities Ri {\textless} Ricr and Rf {\textless} Rfcr. However, it is found that Rfcr  =  0.20–0.25 is a primary threshold for applicability. Applying this prerequisite shows that the data follow classical Monin–Obukhov local z-less predictions after the irrelevant cases (turbulence without the Richardson–Kolmogorov cascade) have been filtered out.},

	abstract = {Since the 1950s, Europe has undergone large shifts in climate and land cover. Previous assessments of past and future changes in evapotranspiration or streamflow have either focussed on land use/cover or climate contributions or on individual catchments under specific climate conditions, but not on all aspects at larger scales. Here, we aim to understand how decadal changes in climate (e.g. precipitation, temperature) and land use (e.g. deforestation/afforestation, urbanization) have impacted the amount and distribution of water resource availability (both evapotranspiration and streamflow) across Europe since the 1950s. To this end, we simulate the distribution of average evapotranspiration and streamflow at high resolution (1\&thinsp;km2) by combining (a) a steady-state Budyko model for water balance partitioning constrained by long-term (lysimeter) observations across different land use types, (b) a novel decadal high-resolution historical land use reconstruction, and (c) gridded observations of key meteorological variables. The continental-scale patterns in the simulations agree well with coarser-scale observation-based estimates of evapotranspiration and also with observed changes in streamflow from small basins across Europe. We find that strong shifts in the continental-scale patterns of evapotranspiration and streamflow have occurred between the period around 1960 and 2010.

 In much of central-western Europe, our results show an increase in evapotranspiration of the order of 5\&thinsp;\%–15\&thinsp;\% between 1955–1965 and 2005–2015, whereas much of the Scandinavian peninsula shows increases exceeding 15\&thinsp;\%. The Iberian Peninsula and other parts of the Mediterranean show a decrease of the order of 5\&thinsp;\%–15\&thinsp;\%. A similar north–south gradient was found for changes in streamflow, although changes in central-western Europe were generally small. Strong decreases and increases exceeding 45\&thinsp;\% were found in parts of the Iberian and Scandinavian peninsulas, respectively. In Sweden, for example, increased precipitation is a larger driver than large-scale reforestation and afforestation, leading to increases in both streamflow and evapotranspiration. In most of the Mediterranean, decreased precipitation combines with increased forest cover and potential evapotranspiration to reduce streamflow. In spite of considerable local- and regional-scale complexity, the response of net actual evapotranspiration to changes in land use, precipitation, and potential evaporation is remarkably uniform across Europe, increasing by ∼\&thinsp;35–60\&thinsp;km3\&thinsp;yr−1, equivalent to the discharge of a large river. For streamflow, effects of changes in precipitation (∼\&thinsp;95\&thinsp;km3\&thinsp;yr−1) dominate land use and potential evapotranspiration contributions (∼\&thinsp;45–60\&thinsp;km3\&thinsp;yr−1). Locally, increased forest cover, forest stand age, and urbanization have led to significant decreases and increases in available streamflow, even in catchments that are considered to be near-natural.},

However, the extent to which non-radiative mechanisms contribute to the local direct temperature response for different types of LCMC across the world remains uncertain. Here, we combine extensive records of remote sensing and in situ observation to show that non-radiative mechanisms dominate the local response in most regions for eight of nine common LCMC perturbations. We find that forest cover gains lead to an annual cooling in all regions south of the upper conterminous United States, northern Europe, and Siberia—reinforcing the attractiveness of re-/afforestation as a local mitigation and adaptation measure in these regions. Our results affirm the importance of accounting for non-radiative mechanisms when evaluating local land-based mitigation or adaptation policies.},

	abstract = {The impact of land use change on regional climate can be substantial but also is variable in space and time. Past observational and modeling work suggests that in a ‘Mediterranean’ climate such as in California’s Central Valley, the impact of irrigated agriculture can be large in the dry season but negligible in the wet season due to seasonal variation in surface energy partitioning. Here we report further analysis of regional climate model simulations showing that diurnal variation in the impact of irrigated agriculture on climate similarly reflects variation in surface energy partitioning, as well as smaller changes in net radiation. With conversion of natural vegetation to irrigated agriculture, statistically significant decreases of 4–8 K at 2 m occurred at midday June–September, and small decreases of {\textasciitilde}1 K occurred in winter months only in relatively dry years. This corresponded to reduced sensible heat flux of 100–350 W m−2 and increased latent heat fluxes of 200–450 W m−2 at the same times and in the same months. We also observed decreases of up to 1,500 m in boundary layer height at midday in summer months, and marginally significant reductions in surface zonal wind speed in July and August at 19:00 PST. The large decrease in daytime temperature due to shifts in energy partitioning overwhelmed any temperature increase related to the reduced zonal sea breeze. Such changes in climate and atmospheric dynamics from conversion to (or away from) irrigated agriculture could have important implications for regional air quality in California’s Central Valley.},

	abstract = {The development of parameterizations is a major task in the development of weather and climate models. Model improvement has been slow in the past decades, due to the difficulty of encompassing key physical processes into parameterizations, but also of calibrating or “tuning” the many free parameters involved in their formulation. Machine learning techniques have been recently used for speeding up the development process. While some studies propose to replace parameterizations by data-driven neural networks, we rather advocate that keeping physical parameterizations is key for the reliability of climate projections. In this paper we propose to harness machine learning to improve physical parameterizations. In particular, we use Gaussian process-based methods from uncertainty quantification to calibrate the model free parameters at a process level. To achieve this, we focus on the comparison of single-column simulations and reference large-eddy simulations over multiple boundary-layer cases. Our method returns all values of the free parameters consistent with the references and any structural uncertainties, allowing a reduced domain of acceptable values to be considered when tuning the three-dimensional (3D) global model. This tool allows to disentangle deficiencies due to poor parameter calibration from intrinsic limits rooted in the parameterization formulations. This paper describes the tool and the philosophy of tuning in single-column mode. Part 2 shows how the results from our process-based tuning can help in the 3D global model tuning.},

	abstract = {We demonstrate a new approach for climate model tuning in a realistic situation. Our approach, the mathematical foundations and technical details of which are given in Part I, systematically uses a single-column configuration of a global atmospheric model on test cases for which reference large-eddy-simulations are available. The space of free parameters is sampled running the single-column model from which metrics are estimated in the full parameter space using emulators. The parameter space is then reduced by retaining only the values for which the emulated metrics match large eddy simulations within a given tolerance to error. The approach is applied to the 6A version of the LMDZ model which results from a long investment in the development of physics parameterizations and by-hand tuning. The boundary layer is revisited by increasing the vertical resolution and varying parameters that were kept fixed so far, which improves the representation of clouds at process scale. The approach allows us to automatically reach a tuning of this modified configuration as good as that of the 6A version. We show how this approach helps accelerate the introduction of new parameterizations. It allows us to maintain the physical foundations of the model and to ensure that the improvement of global metrics is obtained for a reasonable behavior at process level, reducing the risk of error compensations that may arise from over-fitting some climate metrics. That is, we get things right for the right reasons.},

	abstract = {This study presents the version of the LMDZ global atmospheric model used as the atmospheric component of the Institut Pierre Simon Laplace coupled model (IPSL-CM6A-LR) to contribute to the 6th phase of the international Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). This LMDZ6A version includes original convective parameterizations that define the LMDZ “New Physics”: a mass flux parameterization of the organized structures of the convective boundary layer, the “thermal plume model,” and a parameterization of the cold pools created by reevaporation of convective rainfall. The vertical velocity associated with thermal plumes and gust fronts of cold pools are used to control the triggering and intensity of deep convection. Because of several shortcomings, the early version 5B of this New Physics was worse than the previous “Standard Physics” version 5A regarding several classical climate metrics. To overcome these deficiencies, version 6A includes new developments: a stochastic triggering of deep convection, a modification of the thermal plume model that allows the representation of stratocumulus and cumulus clouds in a unified framework, an improved parameterization of very stable boundary layers, and the modification of the gravity waves scheme targeting the quasi-biennal oscillation in the stratosphere. These improvements to the physical content and a more well-defined tuning strategy led to major improvements in the LMDZ6A version model climatology. Beyond the presentation of this particular model version and documentation of its climatology, the present paper underlines possible methodological pathways toward model improvement that can be shared across modeling groups.},

	abstract = {Les sols jouent un rôle important dans le fonctionnement des processus hydrologiques à la surface de la Terre. La dynamique de l’eau dans le sol, l’evaporation ainsi que la transpiration des plantes sont tous des processus fortement contrôles par les proprietes hydrauliques des sols. Ces dernières sont donc essentielles dans l’estimation des flux hydrologiques de surface. L’objectif de cette thèse est d’ameliorer la representation des proprietes hydrologiques des sols dans le modèle ORCHIDEE (ORganizing Carbon and Hydrology in Dynamic EcosystEms), qui decrit les surfaces continentales dans le modèle de climat de l’IPSL (Institut Pierre Simon Laplace), et qui fait donc partie des modèles de surface continentales (land surface models, ou LSMs). Les proprietes du sol sont determinees par la granulometrie de la terre fine, dite texture, et par sa structure, qui caracterise l’assemblage de ses constituants et des pores. Mais dans ORCHIDEE comme dans beaucoup des LSMs, la representation des sols est simplifiee : les proprietes du sol sont deduites à partir d’une carte de texture par des fonctions de pedo-transfert. La première partie de cette thèse presente l’effet de differentes cartes de textures sur les flux hydrologiques simules, à differentes echelles, pour evaluer la reponse du modèle aux differentes textures. Cette partie demontre que, si l’influence de la texture sur les flux simules est bien rendue par le modèle, le choix de la carte de texture joue peu sur les bilans d’eau simules à grande echelle (Tafasca et al., 2020, HESS). Du fait de son rôle avere dans le fonctionnement hydrologique des sols, l’influence de la structure sur les processus hydrologiques est exploree en deuxième partie. La variabilite de la structure au sein d’une même texture de sol amène à des comportements hydrologiques differents. C’est particulièrement le cas des argiles, qui sont habituellement regroupees dans une même classe texturale, malgre une structure et des comportements hydrologiques contrastes entre les argiles gonflantes (Vertisols des zones temperees) et non gonflantes (Oxisols des zones tropicales). Cette thèse propose ainsi une cartographie et des fonctions de pedo-transfert enrichies pour distinguer ces deux types d’argiles. Par ailleurs, un contrôle majeur de la structure est la teneur en matière organique du sol, qui influence fortement la porosite et l’ensemble des proprietes hydrauliques du sol. Plusieurs approches plus globales ont ete testees pour tenir compte de cette influence dans le modèle ORCHIDEE. Une conclusion majeure de cette thèse est que la prise en compte de la structure permet une representation plus realiste des sols ainsi qu’une amelioration de l’evapotranspiration simulee dans le modèle ORCHIDEE.},

	abstract = {Abstract Widespread negative correlations between summertime-mean temperatures and precipitation over land regions are a well-known feature of terrestrial climate. This behavior has generally been interpreted in the context of soil moisture–atmosphere coupling, with soil moisture deficits associated with reduced rainfall leading to enhanced surface sensible heating and higher surface temperature. The present study revisits the genesis of these negative temperature–precipitation correlations using simulations from the Global Land–Atmosphere Coupling Experiment–phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (GLACE-CMIP5) multimodel experiment. The analyses are based on simulations with five climate models, which were integrated with prescribed (noninteractive) and with interactive soil moisture over the period 1950–2100. While the results presented here generally confirm the interpretation that negative correlations between seasonal temperature and precipitation arise through the direct control of soil moisture on surface heat flux partitioning, the presence of widespread negative correlations when soil moisture–atmosphere interactions are artificially removed in at least two out of five models suggests that atmospheric processes, in addition to land surface processes, contribute to the observed negative temperature–precipitation correlation. On longer time scales, the negative correlation between precipitation and temperature is shown to have implications for the projection of climate change impacts on near-surface climate: in all models, in the regions of strongest temperature–precipitation anticorrelation on interannual time scales, long-term regional warming is modulated to a large extent by the regional response of precipitation to climate change, with precipitation increases (decreases) being associated with minimum (maximum) warming. This correspondence appears to arise largely as the result of soil moisture–atmosphere interactions.},

We evaluated the performance of the coupled model (WRF3.3-CLM4crop) by comparing simulated crop growth and surface climate to multiple observational datasets across the continental United States. The results showed that although the model with dynamic crop growth overestimated leaf area index (LAI) and growing season length, interannual variability in peak LAI was improved relative to a model with prescribed crop LAI and growth period, which has no environmental sensitivity. Adding irrigation largely improved daily minimum temperature but the RMSE is still higher over irrigated land than non-irrigated land. Improvements in climate variables were limited by an overall model dry bias. However, with addition of an irrigation scheme, soil moisture and surface energy flux partitioning were largely improved at irrigated sites. Irrigation effects were sensitive to crop growth: the case with prescribed crop growth underestimated irrigation water use and effects on temperature and overestimated soil evaporation relative to the case with dynamic crop growth in moderately irrigated regions. We conclude that studies examining irrigation effects on weather and climate using coupled climate–land surface models should include dynamic crop growth and realistic irrigation schemes to better capture land surface effects in agricultural regions.},

	abstract = {Agricultural irrigation has significant potential for altering local climate by reducing soil albedo, increasing evapotranspiration, and enabling greater leaf area. Numerous studies using regional or global climate models have demonstrated the cooling effects of irrigation on mean and extreme temperature, especially over regions where irrigation is extensive. However, these model-based results have not been well validated due to the limitations of observational data sets. In this study, multiple satellite-based products, including the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) data sets, are used to isolate and quantify the local impacts of irrigation on surface climate over irrigated regions, which are derived from the Global Map of Irrigation Areas (GMIA). The relationships among soil moisture, albedo, evapotranspiration, and surface temperature are explored. Strong evaporative cooling by irrigation lowers daytime surface temperature over arid and semi-arid regions, such as California's Central Valley, the Great Plains, central Asia, and northwestern India. However, the cooling effects are less evident in areas of eastern China and the Lower Mississippi River Basin despite extensive irrigation over these regions. Results are also compared with irrigation experiments using the Community Earth System Model (CESM) to assess the model's ability to represent land–atmosphere interactions in regards to irrigation. CESM greatly underestimates the surface temperature response to irrigation. The comparison between the offline and coupled simulations suggests that the irrigation-induced cooling can be regulated by the interactions between land surface and atmosphere, and amplified signals are found over the “hot spot” regions. Meanwhile, model resolution can also influence the magnitude of the local cooling by irrigation.},

The model is forced by the Safran atmospheric reanalysis at 8-km resolution and hourly time steps from 1959 to 2020, and by a high-resolution DEM (around 1.3 km in France). Each Safran grid cell is decomposed into a graph of hydrological transfer units (HTUs) based on the higher resolution DEM to better describe lateral water movements. In particular, it is possible to accurately locate 3507 stations among the 4081 stations collected from the national hydrometric network HydroPortail (filtered to drain an upstream area larger than 64 km$^{\textrm{2}}$). A simple trial-and-error calibration is conducted by modifying selected parameters of ORCHIDEE to reduce the biases of the simulated water budget compared to the evapotranspiration products (the GLEAM and FLUXCOM datasets) and the HydroPortail observations of river discharge. The simulation that is eventually preferred is extensively assessed with classic goodness-of-fit indicators complemented by trend analysis at 1785 stations (filtered to have records for at least 8 entire years) across France. For example, the median bias of evapotranspiration is \&minus;0.5 \% against GLEAM (\&minus;4.3 \% against FLUXCOM), the median bias of river discharge is 6.3 \%, and the median KGE of square-rooted river discharge is 0.59. The spatial contrasts and temporal trends of river discharge across France are well represented with an accuracy of 76.4 \% for the trend signal and an accuracy of 62.7 \% for the trend significance. Despite inadequate performance in some specific regions (the Alps and the Seine sedimentary basin), this study offers a thorough historical overview of water resources and a robust configuration for climate change impact analysis at the nationwide scale of France.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Nevertheless, its highly spatial heterogeneity across different vegetation types is still missing in the ORCHIDEE-MICT (ORganizing Carbon and Hydrology in Dynamic EcosystEms–aMeliorated Interactions between Carbon and Temperature) land surface model. In this study, we describe the representation of a tiling energy budget in ORCHIDEE-MICT and assess its short-term and long-term impacts on energy, hydrology, and carbon processes. With the specific values of surface properties for each vegetation type, the new version presents warmer surface and soil temperatures (∼ 0.5 °C, +3 \%), wetter soil moisture (∼ 10 kg m−2, +2 \%), and increased soil organic carbon storage (∼ 170 Pg C, +9 \%) across the Northern Hemisphere. Despite reproducing the absolute values and spatial gradients of surface and soil temperatures from satellite and in situ observations, the considerable uncertainties in simulated soil organic carbon and hydrological processes prevent an obvious improvement in the temperature bias existing in the original ORCHIDEE-MICT model. However, the separation of sub-grid energy budgets in the new version improves permafrost simulation greatly by accounting for the presence of discontinuous permafrost types (∼ 3×106 km2), which will facilitate various permafrost-related studies in the future.},

	abstract = {Irrigation water use represents the primary source of freshwater consumption by humans. The amount of water withdrawals for agricultural purposes is expected to further increase in the upcoming years to face the rising world population and higher living standards. Hence, effective plans for enacting a rational management of agricultural water use are urgent, but they are limited by knowledge gaps about irrigation. Detailed information on irrigation dynamics (i.e., extents, timing, and amounts) is generally lacking worldwide, but satellite observations can be used to fill this gap.

 This paper describes the first regional-scale and high-resolution (1 and 6 km) irrigation water data sets obtained from satellite observations. The products are developed over three major river basins characterized by varying irrigation extents and methodologies, as well as by different climatic conditions. The data sets are an outcome of the European Space Agency (ESA) Irrigation+ project. The irrigation amounts have been estimated through the SM-based (soil-moisture-based) inversion approach over the Ebro river basin (northeastern Spain), the Po valley (northern Italy), and the Murray–Darling basin (southeastern Australia). The satellite-derived irrigation products referring to the case studies in Europe have a spatial resolution of 1 km, and they are retrieved by exploiting Sentinel-1 soil moisture data obtained through the RT1 (first-order Radiative Transfer) model. A spatial sampling of 6 km is instead used for the Australian pilot area, since in this case the soil moisture information comes from CYGNSS (Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System) observations. All the irrigation products are delivered with a weekly temporal aggregation. The 1 km data sets over the two European regions cover a period ranging from January 2016 to July 2020, while the irrigation estimates over the Murray–Darling basin are available for the time span April 2017–July 2020. The retrieved irrigation amounts have been compared with benchmark rates collected over selected agricultural districts. Results highlight satisfactory performances over the major part of the pilot sites falling within the two regions characterized by a semiarid climate, namely, the Ebro and the Murray–Darling basins, quantified by median values of RMSE, Pearson correlation r, and bias equal to 12.4 mm/14 d, 0.66, and −4.62 mm/14 d, respectively, for the Ebro basin and to 10.54 mm/month, 0.77, and −3.07 mm/month, respectively, for the Murray–Darling basin. The assessment of the performances over the Po valley is affected by the limited availability of in situ reference data for irrigation. The developed products are made available to the scientific community for use and further validation at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7341284 (Dari et al., 2022a).},

	abstract = {During the warm months of the year in Catalonia, the marine air overcomes the coastal mountain range and reaches the eastern Ebro sub-basin. This phenomenon is called marinada and has recently been thoroughly characterized for the first time by Jimenez et al. (2023), based on surface climatological data. However, the main physical mechanisms involved in its arrival and propagation remain to be discovered. This study aims to understand how the marinada is formed and how it interacts with the already developed atmospheric boundary layer. Surface and atmospheric observations are used in combination with the coupled surface–atmosphere model Meso-NH to reveal the mechanisms at play. It is shown that the marinada is generated by the advection of a cool marine air mass over the Catalan Pre-coastal Range by the action of the sea breeze and the upslope wind. This marine air mass then flows into the Ebro basin, creating what is known as the marinada. The characteristics and dynamics of the marinada allow it to be classified as a fall wind. It is also shown that the arrival, propagation and decay of the marinada is strongly dependent on the larger-scale weather situation: westerlies or thermal low. The current study provides a consistent framework for understanding the marinada, paving the way for better modeling and prediction of the phenomenon.},

	abstract = {Irrigation is becoming increasingly common in agriculture and is essential to meet the growing demand for food. Studies of the impact of irrigated areas on local meteorology reveal a strong influence on near-surface conditions, although the extent of this influence varies considerably between locations. In addition, though theoretical evidence suggests that irrigation can create breeze-like atmospheric boundary-layer circulations, observational evidence is still lacking. This study investigates the effects of irrigation on the surface and atmospheric boundary layer in the Ebro basin, an intensively irrigated area with a semi-arid climate in northeastern Spain. Observational data from the international field campaign Land Surface Interactions with the Atmosphere over the Iberian Semi-arid Environment are analysed together with coupled surface–atmosphere model output to better understand and quantify the impact of irrigation on the lower atmosphere. A simple parametrization of irrigation is shown to improve the accuracy of the model. Results demonstrate that irrigation increases the average latent heat flux by over 200 W·{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}cdotp {\textbackslash}m −2{\textbackslash} {\textasciicircum}-2 {\textbackslash}, reduces air temperature by 4.7°C, and increases specific humidity by 50\% at 2 m during the day over the irrigated region of the domain. Moreover, irrigation limits convection and strongly stabilizes the atmospheric boundary layer. Notably, the study provides evidence for an irrigation-induced breeze from the irrigated area to the semi-arid area. These findings highlight the importance of considering irrigation in numerical models for weather forecasting, climate modelling and sustainable agricultural planning.},

	abstract = {Irrigated agriculture alters near-surface temperature and humidity, which may mask global climate change at the regional scale. However, observational studies of irrigation-induced climate change are lacking in temperate, humid regions throughout North America and Europe. Despite unknown climate impacts, irrigated agriculture is expanding in the Midwest United States, where unconfined aquifers provide groundwater to support crop production on coarse soils. This is the first study in the Midwest United States to observe and quantify differences in regional climate associated with irrigated agricultural conversion from forests and rainfed agriculture. To this end, we established a 60 km transect consisting of 28 stations across varying land uses and monitored surface air temperature and relative humidity for 31 months in the Wisconsin Central Sands region. We used a novel approach to quantify irrigated land use in both space and time with a database containing monthly groundwater withdrawal estimates by parcel for the state of Wisconsin. Irrigated agriculture decreased maximum temperatures and increased minimum temperatures, thus shrinking the diurnal temperature range (DTR) by an average of 3°C. Irrigated agriculture also decreased the vapor pressure deficit (VPD) by an average of 0.10 kPa. Irrigated agriculture significantly decreased evaporative demand for 25\% and 66\% of study days compared to rainfed agriculture and forest, respectively. Differences in VPD across the land-use gradient were highest (0.21 kPa) during the peak of the growing season, while differences in DTR were comparable year-round. Interannual variability in temperature had greater impacts on differences in DTR and VPD across the land-use gradient than interannual variability in precipitation. These regional climate changes must be considered together with increased greenhouse gas emissions, changes to groundwater quality, and surface water degradation when evaluating the costs and benefits of groundwater-sourced irrigation expansion in the Midwest United States and similar regions around the world.},

	abstract = {Irrigation, while being an important anthropogenic factor affecting the local to regional water cycle, is not typically represented in regional climate models. An irrigation scheme is incorporated into the Noah land surface scheme of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model that has a calibrated convective parameterization and a tracer package is used to tag and track water vapor. To assess the impact of irrigation over the California Central Valley (CCV) on the regional climate of the U.S. Southwest, simulations are run (for three dry and three wet years) both with and without the irrigation scheme. Incorporation of the irrigation scheme resulted in simulated surface air temperature and humidity that were closer to observations, decreased depth of the planetary boundary layer over the CCV, and increased convective available potential energy. The result was an overall increase in precipitation over the Sierra Nevada range and the Colorado River basin during the summer. Water vapor rising from the irrigated region mainly moved northeastward and contributed to precipitation in Nevada and Idaho. Specifically, the results indicate increased precipitation on the windward side of the Sierra Nevada and over the Colorado River basin. The former is possibly linked to a sea-breeze-type circulation near the CCV, while the latter is likely associated with a wave pattern related to latent heat release over the moisture transport belt.},

The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Interim Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim) shows more irrigation signal in surface evapotranspiration (ET) than the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) because ERA-Interim adjusts soil moisture according to the observed surface temperature and humidity while MERRA has no explicit consideration of irrigation at the surface. But, when compared with the results from a hydrological model with detailed considerations of agriculture, the ET from both reanalyses show large deficiencies in capturing the impact of irrigation. Here, a back-trajectory method is used to estimate the contribution of irrigation to precipitation over local and surrounding regions, using MERRA with observation-based corrections and added irrigation-caused ET increase from the hydrological model. Results show substantial contributions of irrigation to precipitation over heavily irrigated regions in Asia, but the precipitation increase is much less than the ET increase over most areas, indicating that irrigation could lead to water deficits over these regions. For the same increase in ET, precipitation increases are larger over wetter areas where convection is more easily triggered, but the percentage increase in precipitation is similar for different areas. There are substantial regional differences in the patterns of irrigation impact, but, for all the studied regions, the highest percentage contribution to precipitation is over local land.},

While Part 1 (Do et al., 2018a) describes the data collection process as well as the generation of auxiliary catchment data (e.g. catchment boundary, land cover, mean climate), Part 2 introduces a set of quality controlled time-series indices representing (i) the water balance, (ii) the seasonal cycle, (iii) low flows and (iv) floods. To this end we first consider the quality of individual daily records using a combination of quality flags from data providers and automated screening methods. Subsequently, streamflow time-series indices are computed for yearly, seasonal and monthly resolution. The paper provides a generalized assessment of the homogeneity of all generated streamflow time-series indices, which can be used to select time series that are suitable for a specific task. The newly generated global set of streamflow time-series indices is made freely available with an digital object identifier at https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.887470 and is expected to foster global freshwater research, by acting as a ground truth for model validation or as a basis for assessing the role of human impacts on the terrestrial water cycle. It is hoped that a renewed interest in streamflow data at the global scale will foster efforts in the systematic assessment of data quality and provide momentum to overcome administrative barriers that lead to inconsistencies in global collections of relevant hydrological observations.},

The effects of rapid expansion of irrigated area in the 20th century has remained unclear relative to other land use changes, such as urbanization, that affected a similar total land area. Using spatial and temporal variations in temperature and irrigation extent observed in California, we show that irrigation expansion has had a large cooling effect on summertime average daily daytime temperatures (−0.14°C to −0.25°C per decade), which corresponds to an estimated cooling of −1.8°C to −3.2°C since the introduction of irrigation practices. Irrigation has negligible effects on nighttime temperatures, leading to a net cooling effect of irrigation on climate (−0.06°C to −0.19°C per decade). Stabilization of irrigated area has occurred in California since 1980 and is expected in the near future for many irrigated regions. The suppression of past human-induced greenhouse warming by increased irrigation is therefore likely to slow in the future, and a potential decrease in irrigation may even contribute to a more rapid warming. Changes in irrigation alone are not expected to influence broad-scale temperatures, but they may introduce large uncertainties in climate projections for irrigated agricultural regions, which provide ≈40\% of global food production.},

	abstract = {Irrigation is an essential practice for sustaining global food production and many regional economies. Emerging scientific evidence indicates that irrigation substantially affects mean climate conditions in different regions of the world. Yet how this practice influences climate extremes is currently unknown. Here we use ensemble simulations with the Community Earth System Model to assess the impacts of irrigation on climate extremes. An evaluation of the model performance reveals that irrigation has a small yet overall beneficial effect on the representation of present-day near-surface climate. While the influence of irrigation on annual mean temperatures is limited, we find a large impact on temperature extremes, with a particularly strong cooling during the hottest day of the year (−0.78 K averaged over irrigated land). The strong influence on extremes stems from the timing of irrigation and its influence on land-atmosphere coupling strength. Together these effects result in asymmetric temperature responses, with a more pronounced cooling during hot and/or dry periods. The influence of irrigation is even more pronounced when considering subgrid-scale model output, suggesting that local effects of land management are far more important than previously thought. Our results underline that irrigation has substantially reduced our exposure to hot temperature extremes in the past and highlight the need to account for irrigation in future climate projections.},

Using the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology's Earth System Model, we show that related impacts are not confined regionally but that possibly as much as 40\% of the present-day precipitation in some of the arid regions in Eastern Africa are related to irrigation-based agriculture in Asia. Irrigation in South Asia also substantially influences the climate throughout Southeast Asia and China via the advection of water vapor and by altering the Asian monsoon. The simulated impact of irrigation on remote regions is sensitive to the magnitude of the irrigation-induced moisture flux. Therefore, it is likely that a future extension or decline of irrigated areas due to increasing food demand or declining fresh water resources will also affect precipitation and temperatures in remote regions.},

Here, we use sensitivity experiments to assess the potential of keeping soil moisture conditions at historical levels in the 21st century by “recycling” local water sources (runoff and a reservoir). To this end, we develop a “land water recycling” (LWR) scheme which applies locally available water to the soil if soil moisture drops below a predefined threshold (a historical climatology), and we assess its influence on the hydrology and extreme temperature indices. We run ensemble simulations with the Community Earth System Model for the 21st century and show that our LWR scheme is able to drastically reduce the land area with decreasing soil moisture. Precipitation responds to LWR with increases in mid-latitudes, but decreases in monsoon regions. While effects on global temperature are minimal, there are very substantial regional impacts on climate. Higher evapotranspiration and cloud cover in the simulations both contribute to a decrease in hot temperature extremes. These decreases reach up to about −1\&thinsp;∘C regionally, and are of similar magnitude to the regional climate changes induced by a 0.5\&thinsp;∘C difference in the global mean temperature, e.g. between 1.5 and 2\&thinsp;∘C global warming.},

A series of simulations, with and without irrigation, is conducted over the Southern Great Plains (SGP) for an extremely dry (2006) and wet (2007) year. The results show that including irrigation reduces model bias in soil moisture and surface latent heat (LH) and sensible heat (SH) fluxes, especially during a dry year. Irrigation adds additional water to the surface, leading to changes in the planetary boundary layer. The increase in soil moisture leads to increases in the surface evapotranspiration and near-surface specific humidity but decreases in the SH and surface temperature. Those changes are local and occur during daytime. There is an irrigation-induced decrease in both the lifting condensation level (ZLCL) and mixed-layer depth. The decrease in ZLCL is larger than the decrease in mixed-layer depth, suggesting an increasing probability of shallow clouds. The simulated changes in precipitation induced by irrigation are highly variable in space, and the average precipitation over the SGP region only slightly increases. A high correlation is found among soil moisture, SH, and ZLCL. Larger values of soil moisture in the irrigated simulation due to irrigation in late spring and summer persist into the early fall, suggesting that irrigation-induced soil memory could last a few weeks to months. The results demonstrate the importance of irrigation parameterization for climate studies and improve the process-level understanding on the role of human activity in modulating land–air–cloud interactions.},

The Lerma catchment, a small (7.3km2) sub-catchment of the Ebro Basin in northern Spain.
Study focus
The Lerma catchment underwent a monitored transition to irrigated agriculture, using water from outside the catchment, between 2006 and 2008. This transition has successfully been simulated using the partial-differential-equation-based model HydroGeoSphere, simulating coupled evapotranspiration, surface water, and groundwater flow in the catchment. We use the calibrated model to study how irrigation practices influence the response of the Lerma catchment to the climate change projected for northern Spain. We consider four different irrigation scenarios: no irrigation, present irrigation, climate-adapted irrigation with current crops, and adapted irrigation for crops requiring less water. The climate scenarios are based on four regional climate models and two downscaling methods.
New hydrological insight
The simulated catchment responses to climate change show clear differences between the irrigation scenarios. In future climate, groundwater levels and base flows decrease more when irrigation is present than without irrigation, because groundwater levels and base flow in present climate are already at low levels without irrigation. In contrast, annual peak discharges increase more in non-irrigated cases than in irrigated cases. Irrigation increases water availability and an associated rise in potential evapotranspiration results in higher actual evapotranspiration during summer. In non-irrigated scenarios, by contrast, actual evapotranspiration in summer is controlled by precipitation and thus decreases in future climate.},

In this study we propose a methodology for robustly assessing Arctic mixed-phase cloud properties in a climate model using airborne measurements. We leverage data collected during the RALI-THINICE airborne campaign that took place near Svalbard in August 2022 to evaluate the simulation of mid-level clouds associated with Arctic cyclones. Simulations are carried out with the new limited-area configuration of the ICOLMDZ model which combines the recent icosahedral dynamical core DYNAMICO and the physics of LMDZ, the atmospheric component of the IPSL-CM Earth System Model. Airborne radar and microphysical probes measurements are then used to evaluate the simulated clouds. A comparison method has been set-up to guarantee as much as possible the spatiotemporal co-location between observed and simulated cloud fields. We mostly focus on the representation of ice and liquid in-cloud contents and on their vertical distribution. Results show that the model overestimates the amount of cloud condensates and exhibits a poor cloud phase spatial distribution, with too much liquid water far from cloud top and too much ice close to it. The downward gradual increase in snowfall flux is also not captured by the model. This in-depth model evaluation thereby pinpoints priorities for further improvements in the ICOLMDZ cloud scheme.},

	abstract = {Irrigation modifies land-surface water and energy budgets, and also influences weather and climate. However, current earth-system models, used for weather prediction and climate projection, are still in their infancy stage to consider irrigation effects. This study used long-term data collected from two contrasting (irrigated and rainfed) nearby maize-soybean rotation fields, to study the effects of irrigation memory on local hydroclimate. For a 12 year average, irrigation decreases summer surface-air temperature by less than 1 °C and increases surface humidity by 0.52 g kg−1. The irrigation cooling effect is more pronounced and longer lasting for maize than for soybean. Irrigation reduces maximum, minimum, and averaged temperature over maize by more than 0.5 °C for the first six days after irrigation, but its temperature effect over soybean is mixed and negligible two or three days after irrigation. Irrigation increases near-surface humidity over maize by about 1 g kg−1 up to ten days and increases surface humidity over soybean ( 0.8 g kg−1) with a similar memory. These differing effects of irrigation memory on temperature and humidity are associated with respective changes in the surface sensible and latent heat fluxes for maize and soybean. These findings highlight great need and challenges for earth-system models to realistically simulate how irrigation effects vary with crop species and with crop growth stages, and to capture complex interactions between agricultural management and water-system components (crop transpiration, precipitation, river, reservoirs, lakes, groundwater, etc.) at various spatial and temporal scales.},

We investigated how this redistribution of water affects the global climate, focusing on its effects on near-surface temperatures. Using the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) coupled to the Community Land Model (CLM), we compared global simulations with and without irrigation. To approximate actual irrigation amounts and locations as closely as possible, we used national-level census data of agricultural water withdrawals, disaggregated with maps of croplands, areas equipped for irrigation, and climatic water deficits. We further investigated the sensitivity of our results to the timing and spatial extent of irrigation. We found that irrigation alters climate significantly in some regions, but has a negligible effect on global-average near-surface temperatures. Irrigation cooled the northern mid-latitudes; the central and southeast United States, portions of southeast China and portions of southern and southeast Asia cooled by {\textasciitilde}0.5 K averaged over the year. Much of northern Canada, on the other hand, warmed by {\textasciitilde}1 K. The cooling effect of irrigation seemed to be dominated by indirect effects like an increase in cloud cover, rather than by direct evaporative cooling. The regional effects of irrigation were as large as those seen in previous studies of land cover change, showing that changes in land management can be as important as changes in land cover in terms of their climatic effects. Our results were sensitive to the area of irrigation, but were insensitive to the details of irrigation timing and delivery.},

In the past, most research focused on moisture recycling within a certain region only. This study makes use of new definitions of moisture recycling to study the complete process of continental moisture feedback. Global maps are presented identifying regions that rely heavily on recycled moisture as well as those that are supplying the moisture. An accounting procedure based on ERA‐Interim reanalysis data is used to calculate moisture recycling ratios. It is computed that, on average, 40\% of the terrestrial precipitation originates from land evaporation and that 57\% of all terrestrial evaporation returns as precipitation over land. Moisture evaporating from the Eurasian continent is responsible for 80\% of China's water resources. In South America, the Río de la Plata basin depends on evaporation from the Amazon forest for 70\% of its water resources. The main source of rainfall in the Congo basin is moisture evaporated over East Africa, particularly the Great Lakes region. The Congo basin in its turn is a major source of moisture for rainfall in the Sahel. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that due to the local orography, local moisture recycling is a key process near the Andes and the Tibetan Plateau. Overall, this paper demonstrates the important role of global wind patterns, topography and land cover in continental moisture recycling patterns and the distribution of global water resources.},

Spatial connections between evaporation and precipitation affect the global and regional climates by redistributing water and latent heat. Through this atmospheric moisture recycling, land cover changes influence regional precipitation patterns, with potentially far-reaching effects on human livelihoods and biome distributions across the globe. However, a globally complete dataset of atmospheric moisture flows from evaporation to precipitation has been lacking so far. Here we present a dataset of global atmospheric moisture recycling on both 0.5∘ and 1.0∘ spatial resolution. We simulated the moisture flows between each pair of cells across all land and oceans for 2008–2017 and present their monthly climatological means. We applied the Lagrangian moisture tracking model UTrack, which is forced with ERA5 reanalysis data on 25 atmospheric layers and hourly wind speeds and directions. Due to the global coverage of the simulations, a complete picture of both the upwind source areas of precipitation and downwind target areas of evaporation can be obtained. We show a number of statistics of global atmospheric moisture flows: land recycling, basin recycling, mean latitudinal and longitudinal flows, absolute latitudinal and longitudinal flows, and basin recycling for the 26 largest river basins. We find that, on average, 70\&thinsp;\% of global land evaporation rains down over land, varying between 62\&thinsp;\% and 74\&thinsp;\% across the year; 51\&thinsp;\% of global land precipitation has evaporated from land, varying between 36\&thinsp;\% and 57\&thinsp;\% across the year. The highest basin recycling occurs in the Amazon and Congo basins, with evaporation and precipitation recycling of 63\&thinsp;\% and 36\&thinsp;\% for the Amazon basin and 60\&thinsp;\% and 47\&thinsp;\% for the Congo basin. These statistics are examples of the potential usage of the dataset, which allows users to identify and quantify the moisture flows from and to any area on Earth, from local to global scales.

	abstract = {An ecosystem service is a benefit derived by humanity that can be traced back to an ecological process. Although ecosystem services related to surface water have been thoroughly described, the relationship between atmospheric water and ecosystem services has been mostly neglected, and perhaps misunderstood. Recent advances in land-atmosphere modeling have revealed the importance of terrestrial ecosystems for moisture recycling. In this paper, we analyze the extent to which vegetation sustains the supply of atmospheric moisture and precipitation for downwind beneficiaries, globally. We simulate land-surface evaporation with a global hydrology model and track changes to moisture recycling using an atmospheric moisture budget model, and we define vegetation-regulated moisture recycling as the difference in moisture recycling between current vegetation and a hypothetical desert world. Our results show that nearly a fifth of annual average precipitation falling on land is from vegetation-regulated moisture recycling, but the global variability is large, with many places receiving nearly half their precipitation from this ecosystem service. The largest potential impacts for changes to this ecosystem service are land-use changes across temperate regions in North America and Russia. Likewise, in semi-arid regions reliant on rainfed agricultural production, land-use change that even modestly reduces evaporation and subsequent precipitation, could significantly affect human well-being. We also present a regional case study in the Mato Grosso region of Brazil, where we identify the specific moisture recycling ecosystem services associated with the vegetation in Mato Grosso. We find that Mato Grosso vegetation regulates some internal precipitation, with a diffuse region of benefit downwind, primarily to the south and east, including the La Plata River basin and the megacities of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. We synthesize our global and regional results into a generalized framework for describing moisture recycling as an ecosystem service. We conclude that future work ought to disentangle whether and how this vegetation-regulated moisture recycling interacts with other ecosystem services, so that trade-offs can be assessed in a comprehensive and sustainable manner.},

	abstract = {Regional climate models are increasingly used to add small-scale features that are not present in their lateral boundary conditions (LBC). It is well known that the limited area over which a model is integrated must be large enough to allow the full development of small-scale features. On the other hand, integrations on very large domains have shown important departures from the driving data, unless large scale nudging is applied. The issue of domain size is studied here by using the “perfect model” approach. This method consists first of generating a high-resolution climatic simulation, nicknamed big brother (BB), over a large domain of integration. The next step is to degrade this dataset with a low-pass filter emulating the usual coarse-resolution LBC. The filtered nesting data (FBB) are hence used to drive a set of four simulations (LBs for Little Brothers), with the same model, but on progressively smaller domain sizes. The LB statistics for a climate sample of four winter months are compared with BB over a common region. The time average (stationary) and transient-eddy standard deviation patterns of the LB atmospheric fields generally improve in terms of spatial correlation with the reference (BB) when domain gets smaller. The extraction of the small-scale features by using a spectral filter allows detecting important underestimations of the transient-eddy variability in the vicinity of the inflow boundary, which can penalize the use of small domains (less than 100 × 100 grid points). The permanent “spatial spin-up” corresponds to the characteristic distance that the large-scale flow needs to travel before developing small-scale features. The spin-up distance tends to grow in size at higher levels in the atmosphere.},

	abstract = {The issue of Regional Climate Model (RCM) domain size is studied here by using a perfect-model approach, also known as the Big-Brother experiment. It is known that the control exerted by the lateral boundary conditions (LBC) on nested simulations increases when reducing the domain size. The large-scale component of the simulation that is forced by the LBC influences the small-scale features that develop along the large-scale flow. Small-scale transient eddies need space and time to develop sufficiently however, and small domains can impede their development. Our tests performed over eastern North America in summer reveal that the small-scale features are systematically underestimated over the entire domain, even for domain as large as 140 by 140 grid points. This result differs from that obtained in winter where the small scales were mainly underestimated on the west (inflow) side of the domain. This difference is due to the circulation regime over Eastern Canada, which is characterized by weak and variable flow in summer, but strong and westerly flow in winter. For both seasons, the small-scale transient-eddy amplitudes are systematically underestimated at higher levels, but this problem is less severe in summer. Overall the model is more skilful in regenerating the small scales in summer than in winter for comparable domain sizes, which can be related to the weaker summer flow and stronger physical processes occurring in this season.},

	abstract = {Dynamical downscaling by atmospheric Regional Climate Models (RCMs) forced with low-resolution data should produce climate details and add quality and value to the low-resolution data. The aim of this study was to explore the importance of (i) the oceanic surface forcing (sea-surface temperature (SST) and sea-ice), (ii) the lateral boundary condition data, and (iii) the size of the integration domain with respect to improved quality and value in dynamically downscaled data. Experiments addressing the three aspects were performed and the results were investigated for mean sea level pressure (mslp), 2 m air temperature (T2m) and daily precipitation. Although changes in SST gave a clear response locally, changes in the lateral boundary data and the size of the integration domain turned out to be more important with our geographical scope being Norway. The T2m turned out less sensitive to the changes in lateral forcing and the size of the integration domain than mslp and precipitation. The sensitivity for all three variables differed between Norwegian regions; northern parts of Norway were the most sensitive. Even though the sensitivities found in this study might be different in other regions and for other RCMs, these results call for careful consideration when choosing integration domain and driving lateral boundary data when performing dynamical downscaling.},

	abstract = {Regional climate models (RCM) are an important tool for simulating atmospheric information at finer resolutions often of greater relevance to local scale climate change impact assessment studies. The lateral and lower boundary conditions, which form the inputs to the RCM downscaling application, are outputs from the global climate model (GCM). These boundary variables are known to be biased in GCMs, providing the potential to use a statistical approach that corrects these biases before use in downscaling. An array of bias correction techniques have been developed to remove these biases before being used to drive the RCM, but questions remain on their efficacy in terms of the final downscaled output. This study assesses the impact of these bias correction strategies by focussing on how these corrections are translated as one proceeds from the lateral boundaries into the model interior. Of specific interest is the change in the correction from generation of the lateral boundary conditions as well as how correction information moves through the relaxation zone and into the interior of the model. Here we show that bias correction information passing into the regional climate model is limited by interpolations required to generate lateral boundary conditions and dominant outflow wind conditions in the boundaries. This work suggests that these limitations should be addressed in order for bias correction of lateral boundary conditions to robustly influence RCM simulations of climate in the interior of the model domain.},

	abstract = {Spatial soil water-holding capacities were estimated for the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) digital Soil Map of the World (SMW) by employing continuous pedotransfer functions (PTF) within global pedon databases and linking these results to the SMW. The procedure first estimated representative soil properties for the FAO soil units by statistical analyses and taxotransfer depth algorithms [Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), 1996]. The representative soil properties estimated for two layers of depths (0–30 and 30–100 cm) included particle-size distribution, dominant soil texture, organic carbon content, coarse fragments, bulk density, and porosity. After representative soil properties for the FAO soil units were estimated, these values were substituted into three different pedotransfer functions (PTF) models by Rawls et al. [1982], Saxton et al. [1986], and Batjes [1996a]. The Saxton PTF model was finally selected to calculate available water content because it only required particle-size distribution data and results closely agreed with the Rawls and Batjes PTF models that used both particle-size distribution and organic matter data. Soil water-holding capacities were then estimated by multiplying the available water content by the soil layer thickness and integrating over an effective crop root depth of 1 m or less (i.e., encountered shallow impermeable layers) and another soil depth data layer of 2.5 m or less.},

	abstract = {The representation of stratocumulus clouds, and of the stratocumulus to cumulus transitions which are ubiquitous features of marine boundary layer clouds, remains a challenge for climate models. We show how a mass flux representation of boundary layer convective structures combined with an eddy diffusivity scheme, the “thermal plume model,” first developed to represent cumulus clouds, can also adequately simulate stratocumulus and the stratocumulus to cumulus transition in a climate model. To achieve this, the detrainment formulation, in which detrainment increases for increasing negative buoyancy, has to be slightly modified: the buoyancy of a thermal plume parcel of air is computed by comparing the virtual potential temperature θv,th of the parcel with that of the surrounding environment θv,env at a given distance above instead of at the same level. This is consistent with the picture of detrained air parcels that experience some overshoot and reach a final destination at a level lower than the one at which they effectively leave the cloud or organized convective plume. The impacts of this modification are documented both for selected cases of stratocumulus, in comparison with large-eddy simulations, and in full 3-D climate simulations, in comparison with satellite observations of cloud cover. The modified scheme provides a uniform treatment of the dry convective boundary layer, of cumulus clouds, of stratocumulus, and of the transition from stratocumulus to cumulus. It is included in the most recent version of the LMDZ atmospheric general circulation model.},

	abstract = {A rapid and accurate radiative transfer model (RRTM) for climate applications has been developed and the results extensively evaluated. The current version of RRTM calculates fluxes and cooling rates for the longwave spectral region (10–3000 cm−1) for an arbitrary clear atmosphere. The molecular species treated in the model are water vapor, carbon dioxide, ozone, methane, nitrous oxide, and the common halocarbons. The radiative transfer in RRTM is performed using the correlated-k method: the k distributions are attained directly from the LBLRTM line-by-line model, which connects the absorption coefficients used by RRTM to high-resolution radiance validations done with observations. Refined methods have been developed for treating bands containing gases with overlapping absorption, for the determination of values of the Planck function appropriate for use in the correlated-k approach, and for the inclusion of minor absorbing species in a band. The flux and cooling rate results of RRTM are linked to measurement through the use of LBLRTM, which has been substantially validated with observations. Validations of RRTM using LBLRTM have been performed for the midlatitude summer, tropical, midlatitude winter, subarctic winter, and four atmospheres from the Spectral Radiance Experiment campaign. On the basis of these validations the longwave accuracy of RRTM for any atmosphere is as follows: 0.6 W m−2 (relative to LBLRTM) for net flux in each band at all altitudes, with a total (10–3000 cm−1) error of less than 1.0 W m−2 at any altitude; 0.07 K d−1 for total cooling rate error in the troposphere and lower stratosphere, and 0.75 K d−1 in the upper stratosphere and above. Other comparisons have been performed on RRTM using LBLRTM to gauge its sensitivity to changes in the abundance of specific species, including the halocarbons and carbon dioxide. The radiative forcing due to doubling the concentration of carbon dioxide is attained with an accuracy of 0.24 W m−2, an error of less than 5\%. The speed of execution of RRTM compares favorably with that of other rapid radiation models, indicating that the model is suitable for use in general circulation models.},

The cloud parameterizations in recent versions of LMDZ favor an object-oriented approach for convection, with two distinct parameterizations for shallow and deep convection and a coupling between convection and cloud description through the specification of the subgrid-scale distribution of water. Compared to the previous version of the model (LMDZ5A), LMDZ6A better represents the low-level cloud distribution in the tropical belt, and low-level cloud reflectance and cover are closer to the PARASOL and CALIPSO-GOCCP observations. Mid-level clouds, which were mostly missing in LMDZ5A, are now better represented globally. The distribution of cloud liquid and ice in mixed-phase clouds is also in better agreement with the observations. Among identified deficiencies, low-level cloud covers are too high in mid-latitude to high-latitude regions, and high-level cloud covers are biased low globally. However, the cloud global distribution is significantly improved, and progress has been made in the tuning of the model, resulting in a radiative balance in close agreement with the CERES observations. Improved tuning also revealed structural biases in LMDZ6A, which are currently being addressed through a series of new physical and radiative parameterizations for the next version of LMDZ.},

	abstract = {Land surface models (LSMs) use the atmospheric grid as their basic spatial decomposition because their main objective is to provide the lower boundary conditions to the atmosphere. Lateral water flows at the surface on the other hand require a much higher spatial discretization as they are closely linked to topographic details. We propose here a methodology to automatically tile the atmospheric grid into hydrological coherent units which are connected through a graph. As water is transported on sub-grids of the LSM, land variables can easily be transferred to the routing network and advected if needed. This is demonstrated here for temperature. The quality of the river networks generated, as represented by the connected hydrological transfer units, are compared to the original data in order to quantify the degradation introduced by the discretization method. The conditions the sub-grid elements impose on the time step of the water transport scheme are evaluated, and a methodology is proposed to find an optimal value. Finally the scheme is applied in an off-line version of the ORCHIDEE (Organising Carbon and Hydrology In Dynamic Ecosystems) LSM over Europe to show that realistic river discharge and temperatures are predicted over the major catchments of the region. The simulated solutions are largely independent of the atmospheric grid used thanks to the proposed sub-grid approach.},

	abstract = {Within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), ECMWF is producing the ERA5 reanalysis which, once completed, will embody a detailed record of the global atmosphere, land surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards. This new reanalysis replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis (spanning 1979 onwards) which was started in 2006. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) Cy41r2 which was operational in 2016. ERA5 thus benefits from a decade of developments in model physics, core dynamics and data assimilation. In addition to a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31 km, compared to 80 km for ERA-Interim, ERA5 has hourly output throughout, and an uncertainty estimate from an ensemble (3-hourly at half the horizontal resolution). This paper describes the general set-up of ERA5, as well as a basic evaluation of characteristics and performance, with a focus on the dataset from 1979 onwards which is currently publicly available. Re-forecasts from ERA5 analyses show a gain of up to one day in skill with respect to ERA-Interim. Comparison with radiosonde and PILOT data prior to assimilation shows an improved fit for temperature, wind and humidity in the troposphere, but not the stratosphere. A comparison with independent buoy data shows a much improved fit for ocean wave height. The uncertainty estimate reflects the evolution of the observing systems used in ERA5. The enhanced temporal and spatial resolution allows for a detailed evolution of weather systems. For precipitation, global-mean correlation with monthly-mean GPCP data is increased from 67\% to 77\%. In general, low-frequency variability is found to be well represented and from 10 hPa downwards general patterns of anomalies in temperature match those from the ERA-Interim, MERRA-2 and JRA-55 reanalyses.},

	abstract = {The Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) is a set of algorithms dedicated to the estimation of terrestrial evaporation and root-zone soil moisture from satellite data. Ever since its development in 2011, the model has been regularly revised, aiming at the optimal incorporation of new satellite-observed geophysical variables, and improving the representation of physical processes. In this study, the next version of this model (v3) is presented. Key changes relative to the previous version include (1) a revised formulation of the evaporative stress, (2) an optimized drainage algorithm, and (3) a new soil moisture data assimilation system. GLEAM v3 is used to produce three new data sets of terrestrial evaporation and root-zone soil moisture, including a 36-year data set spanning 1980–2015, referred to as v3a (based on satellite-observed soil moisture, vegetation optical depth and snow-water equivalent, reanalysis air temperature and radiation, and a multi-source precipitation product), and two satellite-based data sets. The latter share most of their forcing, except for the vegetation optical depth and soil moisture, which are based on observations from different passive and active C- and L-band microwave sensors (European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative, ESA CCI) for the v3b data set (spanning 2003–2015) and observations from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite in the v3c data set (spanning 2011–2015). Here, these three data sets are described in detail, compared against analogous data sets generated using the previous version of GLEAM (v2), and validated against measurements from 91 eddy-covariance towers and 2325 soil moisture sensors across a broad range of ecosystems. Results indicate that the quality of the v3 soil moisture is consistently better than the one from v2: average correlations against in situ surface soil moisture measurements increase from 0.61 to 0.64 in the case of the v3a data set and the representation of soil moisture in the second layer improves as well, with correlations increasing from 0.47 to 0.53. Similar improvements are observed for the v3b and c data sets. Despite regional differences, the quality of the evaporation fluxes remains overall similar to the one obtained using the previous version of GLEAM, with average correlations against eddy-covariance measurements ranging between 0.78 and 0.81 for the different data sets. These global data sets of terrestrial evaporation and root-zone soil moisture are now openly available at www.GLEAM.eu and may be used for large-scale hydrological applications, climate studies, or research on land–atmosphere feedbacks.},

	abstract = {The design of the icosahedral dynamical core DYNAMICO is presented. DYNAMICO solves the multi-layer rotating shallow-water equations, a compressible variant of the same equivalent to a discretization of the hydrostatic primitive equations in a Lagrangian vertical coordinate, and the primitive equations in a hybrid mass-based vertical coordinate. The common Hamiltonian structure of these sets of equations is exploited to formulate energy-conserving spatial discretizations in a unified way. 

 The horizontal mesh is a quasi-uniform icosahedral C-grid obtained by subdivision of a regular icosahedron. Control volumes for mass, tracers and entropy/potential temperature are the hexagonal cells of the Voronoi mesh to avoid the fast numerical modes of the triangular C-grid. The horizontal discretization is that of Ringler et al. (2010), whose discrete quasi-Hamiltonian structure is identified. The prognostic variables are arranged vertically on a Lorenz grid with all thermodynamical variables collocated with mass. The vertical discretization is obtained from the three-dimensional Hamiltonian formulation. Tracers are transported using a second-order finite-volume scheme with slope limiting for positivity. Explicit Runge–Kutta time integration is used for dynamics, and forward-in-time integration with horizontal/vertical splitting is used for tracers. Most of the model code is common to the three sets of equations solved, making it easier to develop and validate each piece of the model separately. 

 Representative three-dimensional test cases are run and analyzed, showing correctness of the model. The design permits to consider several extensions in the near future, from higher-order transport to more general dynamics, especially deep-atmosphere and non-hydrostatic equations.},

	abstract = {River routing is a critical component of land surface models (LSMs), as it plays a significant role in the closure of the water balance at global scale, linking the estimation of river discharge to the one of sea level. The estimation of river discharge within LSMs also enables researchers to use widely available discharge observations to evaluate their models, and to study the human impact on discharge. However, river discharge calculation is often simplified in continental to global scale applications, as topography varies at a much smaller scale than the one of LSM grid-scales, which requires sub-grid parameterizations.In this study, we present a revision of the current routing module of the ORCHIDEE LSM (Nguyen-Quang et al., 2018) that aims to improve the accuracy of discharge estimation in an agile way. We propose a simple, parallelized, conservative routing module that is based on principal flow directions at the digital elevation model (DEM) scale and independent of the LSM grid cell, enabling the use of routing maps at various resolutions. The influence of topography is factored in by the topographic index, i.e. a product of slope and pixel length in each routing cell. The routing can be solved directly on DEM native grid using conservative interpolations of run-off and drainage computed from LSM. To reduce the computational cost, we developed an upscaling method by aggregating DEM pixels into irregular hydrological transfer units (HTUs), which respect the basin hierarchy by construction, therefore making the computation of effective topographic index straightforward, and which is constrained by validity of the numerical stability criteria. This upscaling method drastically reduces the computational cost, by a factor depending on the targeted resolution, without compromising the discharge estimation.We test this new routing module via offline simulations, to evaluate the discharge within 10 of the world's largest river basins, at the outlet and in upstream sub-catchments. To this end we use a 2km version of the MERIT global DEM to derive information on flow direction, slope and pixel length; and the GRDC global river discharge observation dataset to evaluate the simulated river discharge. First, using the routing at the DEM pixel scale, we will tune the lag time of reservoirs to improve the discharge estimation. Then, we will test the stability of performances when upscaling the routing over a range of HTU lengths. This work is pivotal for the use of ORCHIDEE and its routing scale at various spatial scales, either off-line or coupled to the IPSL climate model, especially with its scalable atmospheric dynamical core, which is based on a quasi-uniform icosahedral-hexagonal mesh, and can be used for both global or limited-area simulations (Dubos et al., 2015).References:Dubos, T., Dubey, S., Tort, M., Mittal, R., Meurdesoif, Y., and Hourdin, F.: DYNAMICO-1.0, an icosahedral hydrostatic dynamical core designed for consistency and versatility, Geosci.

	abstract = {The evolution and possible limitation of water resources under climate change will become a crucial problem over the next decades and accurate hydrological projections are fundamental tools to assess the problem. The goal of this study is to improve the simulation of both river discharges and evaporation with the ORCHIDEE (Organising Carbon and Hydrology in Dynamic Ecosystems) land surface model by accounting for a high-resolution river network and water management influence.This work will allow us to produce long-term projections of river discharge in France under different regional-scale climate change scenarios for the national project Explore2 and the French climate services.To this end, we present here the evaluation and calibration of an improved version of ORCHIDEE, run off-line over France with atmospheric forcing from the SAFRAN reanalysis at an 8-km resolution and 1-hourly time step. First, we implement a high-resolution river routing scheme recently developed to better reproduce the water flow through the river network from the source to the outlet. It relies on topographical and hydrological information from the MERIT Hydro (Multi-Error-Removed Improved-Terrain) digital elevation model scaled at a 2km resolution, which allows us to define sub-basins at a higher resolution than the atmospheric forcing and to correctly position a majority of French gauging stations along the reconstructed rivers.By comparing the discharge simulations to observations from the French hydrometric database (http://hydro.eaufrance.fr/) on about 800 stations with variable upstream areas, selected for their long and good-quality record, and medium-to-low human pressures, we find a very general overestimation of river discharge by the model, except in mountainous areas where earlier studies showed that the SAFRAN reanalysis was underestimating precipitation. The comparison of the simulated evapotranspiration to the data-driven FLUXCOM gridded product, over the upstream area of each selected station, shows a systematic underestimation, which can be explained by the underestimation of precipitation over mountains, and is elsewhere consistent with the overestimation of river discharge.Further comparison to water withdrawals and consumption data from the national database BNPE (http://bnpe.eaufrance.fr/) suggests that both river discharge overestimate and evapotranspiration underestimate can be partly attributed to the neglect of water management in ORCHIDEE, although the studied stations have been selected for their weak human influence. We will thus incorporate water management information in ORCHIDEE in two ways: by activating an irrigation parametrization to consistently describe the impact of this human pressure on both river discharge and evapotranspiration, and by reducing river discharge from the other abstraction sources. The related parameters will finally be calibrated such as to best reproduce the observed discharge, evapotranspiration, and irrigation withdrawals.},

	abstract = {Climate Data Records of soil moisture are fundamental for improving our understanding of long-term dynamics in the coupled water, energy, and carbon cycles over land. To respond to this need, in 2012 the European Space Agency (ESA) released the first multi-decadal, global satellite-observed soil moisture (SM) dataset as part of its Climate Change Initiative (CCI) program. This product, named ESA CCI SM, combines various single-sensor active and passive microwave soil moisture products into three harmonised products: a merged ACTIVE, a merged PASSIVE, and a COMBINED active+passive microwave product. Compared to the first product release, the latest version of ESA CCI SM includes a large number of enhancements, incorporates various new satellite sensors, and extends its temporal coverage to the period 1978–2015. In this study, we first provide a comprehensive overview of the characteristics, evolution, and performance of the ESA CCI SM products. Based on original research and a review of existing literature we show that the product quality has steadily increased with each successive release and that the merged products generally outperform the single-sensor input products. Although ESA CCI SM generally agrees well with the spatial and temporal patterns estimated by land surface models and observed in-situ, we identify surface conditions (e.g., dense vegetation, organic soils) for which it still has large uncertainties. Second, capitalising on the results of {\textgreater}100 research studies that made use of the ESA CCI SM data we provide a synopsis of how it has contributed to improved process understanding in the following Earth system domains: climate variability and change, land-atmosphere interactions, global biogeochemical cycles and ecology, hydrological and land surface modelling, drought applications, and meteorology. While in some disciplines the use of ESA CCI SM is already widespread (e.g. in the evaluation of model soil moisture states) in others (e.g. in numerical weather prediction or flood forecasting) it is still in its infancy. The latter is partly related to current shortcomings of the product, e.g., the lack of near-real-time availability and data gaps in time and space. This study discloses the discrepancies between current ESA CCI SM product characteristics and the preferred characteristics of long-term satellite soil moisture products as outlined by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), and provides important directions for future ESA CCI SM product improvements to bridge these gaps.},

	abstract = {The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission is European Space Agency (ESA's) second Earth Explorer Opportunity mission, launched in November 2009. It is a joint program between ESA Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) and Centro para el Desarrollo Tecnologico Industrial. SMOS carries a single payload, an L-Band 2-D interferometric radiometer in the 1400-1427 MHz protected band. This wavelength penetrates well through the atmosphere, and hence the instrument probes the earth surface emissivity. Surface emissivity can then be related to the moisture content in the first few centimeters of soil, and, after some surface roughness and temperature corrections, to the sea surface salinity over ocean. The goal of the level 2 algorithm is thus to deliver global soil moisture (SM) maps with a desired accuracy of 0.04 m3/m3. To reach this goal, a retrieval algorithm was developed and implemented in the ground segment which processes level 1 to level 2 data. Level 1 consists mainly of angular brightness temperatures (TB), while level 2 consists of geophysical products in swath mode, i.e., as acquired by the sensor during a half orbit from pole to pole. In this context, a group of institutes prepared the SMOS algorithm theoretical basis documents to be used to produce the operational algorithm. The principle of the SM retrieval algorithm is based on an iterative approach which aims at minimizing a cost function. The main component of the cost function is given by the sum of the squared weighted differences between measured and modeled TB data, for a variety of incidence angles. The algorithm finds the best set of the parameters, e.g., SM and vegetation characteristics, which drive the direct TB model and minimizes the cost function. The end user Level 2 SM product contains SM, vegetation opacity, and estimated dielectric constant of any surface, TB computed at 42.5°, flags and quality indices, and other parameters of interest. This paper gives an overview of the algorithm, discusses the caveats, and provides a glimpse of the Cal Val exercises.},

Apart from the horizontal resolution the CERRA and CERRA-EDA setups are the same; for example, the same data assimilation scheme, same physics parameterization as well as the same vertical levels. These new systems are built from HARMONIE cy40 version, including some back-phased physics from a newer model version (cy42). Conventional observations, satellite-based radiances, atmospheric motion vector winds and bending angle from radio occultation observations are used. In addition, ground-based zenith total delay (ZTD) from global navigational satellite systems (GNSS) and local surface observations, rescued from historical archives at the local National Meteorological Services, are used. Another new feature is the construction of the background error statistics for the data assimilation. Information from the ensemble run, CERRA-EDA, is used in the derivation of the background error statistics for the high-resolution CERRA runs. These background error statistics are updated every second day. By doing so, daily environment variation is taken into account as well as all variations over the 37 years of production. The reanalyses and reforecasts from CERRA show an added value compared to the global ERA5 for almost all variables at the surface level. This becomes particularly clear when selecting smaller areas with complex terrain where the high resolution is beneficial. In the free atmosphere it is primarily the analyses and short forecasts, 3–6 hours, that give an added value.},

	abstract = {High-resolution raster hydrography maps are a fundamental data source for many geoscience applications. Here we introduce MERIT Hydro, a new global flow direction map at 3-arc sec resolution ( 90 m at the equator) derived from the latest elevation data (MERIT DEM) and water body data sets (G1WBM, Global Surface Water Occurrence, and OpenStreetMap). We developed a new algorithm to extract river networks near automatically by separating actual inland basins from dummy depressions caused by the errors in input elevation data. After a minimum amount of hand editing, the constructed hydrography map shows good agreement with existing quality-controlled river network data sets in terms of flow accumulation area and river basin shape. The location of river streamlines was realistically aligned with existing satellite-based global river channel data. Relative error in the drainage area was {\textless}0.05 for 90\% of Global Runoff Data Center (GRDC) gauges, confirming the accuracy of the delineated global river networks. Discrepancies in flow accumulation area were found mostly in arid river basins containing depressions that are occasionally connected at high water levels and thus resulting in uncertain watershed boundaries. MERIT Hydro improves on existing global hydrography data sets in terms of spatial coverage (between N90 and S60) and representation of small streams, mainly due to increased availability of high-quality baseline geospatial data sets. The new flow direction and flow accumulation maps, along with accompanying supplementary layers on hydrologically adjusted elevation and channel width, will advance geoscience studies related to river hydrology at both global and local scales.},

	abstract = {The Lund–Potsdam–Jena Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (LPJ) combines process-based, large-scale representations of terrestrial vegetation dynamics and land-atmosphere carbon and water exchanges in a modular framework. Features include feedback through canopy conductance between photosynthesis and transpiration and interactive coupling between these ‘fast’ processes and other ecosystem processes including resource competition, tissue turnover, population dynamics, soil organic matter and litter dynamics and fire disturbance. Ten plants functional types (PFTs) are differentiated by physiological, morphological, phenological, bioclimatic and fire-response attributes. Resource competition and differential responses to fire between PFTs influence their relative fractional cover from year to year. Photosynthesis, evapotranspiration and soil water dynamics are modelled on a daily time step, while vegetation structure and PFT population densities are updated annually. Simulations have been made over the industrial period both for specific sites where field measurements were available for model evaluation, and globally on a 0.5°° × 0.5°° grid. Modelled vegetation patterns are consistent with observations, including remotely sensed vegetation structure and phenology. Seasonal cycles of net ecosystem exchange and soil moisture compare well with local measurements. Global carbon exchange fields used as input to an atmospheric tracer transport model (TM2) provided a good fit to observed seasonal cycles of CO2 concentration at all latitudes. Simulated inter-annual variability of the global terrestrial carbon balance is in phase with and comparable in amplitude to observed variability in the growth rate of atmospheric CO2. Global terrestrial carbon and water cycle parameters (pool sizes and fluxes) lie within their accepted ranges. The model is being used to study past, present and future terrestrial ecosystem dynamics, biochemical and biophysical interactions between ecosystems and the atmosphere, and as a component of coupled Earth system models.},

	abstract = {The water cycle regulates and reflects natural variability in climate at the regional and global scales. Large-scale human activities that involve changes in land cover, such as tropical deforestation, are likely to modify climate through changes in the water cycle. In order to understand, and hopefully be able to predict, the extent of these potential global and regional changes, we need first to understand how the water cycle works. In the past, most of the research in hydrology focused on the land branch of the water cycle, with little attention given to the atmospheric branch. The study of precipitation recycling, which is defined as the contribution of local evaporation to local precipitation, aims at understanding hydrologic processes in the atmospheric branch of the water cycle. Simply stated, any study on precipitation recycling is about how the atmospheric branch of the water cycle works, namely, what happens to water vapor molecules after they evaporate from the surface, and where will they precipitate? Estimation of precipitation recycling over any large basin, such as the Mississippi or the Amazon, is a necessary step before developing a quantitative description of the regional water cycle. This paper reviews the research on the concept of precipitation recycling and emphasizes the basic role of this process in defining the different components of the atmospheric branch in any regional water cycle. To illustrate the assumptions and limitations involved in estimation of precipitation recycling, we present and discuss a general formula for estimation of precipitation recycling. The recent estimates of annual precipitation recycling ratio from different regions are reviewed and compared. Finally, the dependence of precipitation recycling over any region on the spatial scale is discussed and illustrated by the example of the Amazon basin.},

	abstract = {The onset of moist convection over land is investigated using a conceptual approach with a slab boundary layer model. The authors determine the essential factors for the onset of boundary layer clouds over land and study their relative importance. They are 1) the ratio of the temperature to the moisture lapse rates of the free troposphere, that is, the inversion Bowen ratio; 2) the mean daily surface temperature; 3) the relative humidity of the free troposphere; and 4) the surface evaporative fraction. A clear transition is observed between two regimes of moistening of the boundary layer as assessed by the relative humidity at the boundary layer top. In the first so-called wet soil advantage regime, the moistening results from the increase of the mixed-layer specific humidity, which linearly depends on the surface evaporative fraction and inversion Bowen ratio through a dynamic boundary layer factor. In the second so-called dry soil advantage regime, the relative humidity tendency at the boundary layer top is controlled by the thermodynamics and changes in the moist adiabatic induced by the decreased temperature at the boundary layer top and consequent reduction in saturation water vapor pressure. This regime pertains to very deep boundary layers under weakly stratified free troposphere over hot surface conditions. In the context of the conceptual model, a rise in free-tropospheric temperature (global warming) increases the occurrence of deep convection and reduces the cloud cover over moist surfaces. This study provides new intuition and predictive capacity on the mechanism controlling the occurrence of moist convection over land.},

	abstract = {The feedback between soil moisture and precipitation has long been a topic of interest due to its potential for improving weather and seasonal forecasts. The generally proposed mechanism assumes a control of soil moisture on precipitation via the partitioning of the surface turbulent heat fluxes, as assessed via the evaporative fraction (EF), i.e., the ratio of latent heat to the sum of latent and sensible heat, in particular under convective conditions. Our study investigates the poorly understood link between EF and precipitation by relating the before-noon EF to the frequency of afternoon precipitation over the contiguous US, through statistical analyses of multiple EF and precipitation data sets. We analyze remote-sensing data products (Global Land Evaporation: the Amsterdam Methodology (GLEAM) for EF, and radar precipitation from the NEXt generation weather RADar system (NEXRAD)), FLUXNET station data, and the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR). Data sets agree on a region of positive relationship between EF and precipitation occurrence in the southwestern US. However, a region of strong positive relationship over the eastern US in NARR cannot be confirmed with observation-derived estimates (GLEAM, NEXRAD and FLUXNET). The GLEAM–NEXRAD data set combination indicates a region of positive EF–precipitation relationship in the central US. These disagreements emphasize large uncertainties in the EF data. Further analyses highlight that much of these EF–precipitation relationships could be explained by precipitation persistence alone, and it is unclear whether EF has an additional role in triggering afternoon precipitation. This also highlights the difficulties in isolating a land impact on precipitation. Regional analyses point to contrasting mechanisms over different regions. Over the eastern US, our analyses suggest that the EF–precipitation relationship in NARR is either atmospherically controlled (from precipitation persistence and potential evaporation) or driven by vegetation interception rather than soil moisture. Although this aligns well with the high forest cover and the wet regime of that region, the role of interception evaporation is likely overestimated because of low nighttime evaporation in NARR. Over the central and southwestern US, the EF–precipitation relationship is additionally linked to soil moisture variations, owing to the soil-moisture-limited climate regime.},

	abstract = {Granger causality (GC) is used in the econometrics literature to identify the presence of one- and two-way coupling between terms in noisy multivariate dynamical systems. Here we test for the presence of GC to identify a soil moisture (S) feedback on precipitation (P) using data from Illinois. In this framework S is said to Granger cause P if F(Pt{\textbar}Ωt−Δt)≠F(Pt{\textbar}Ωt−Δt−St−Δt) where F denotes the conditional distribution of P, Ωt−Δt represents the set of all knowledge available at time t−Δt, and Ωt−Δt−St−Δt represents all knowledge except S. Critical for land–atmosphere interaction research is that Ωt−Δt includes all past information on P as well as S. Therefore that part of the relation between past soil moisture and current precipitation which results from precipitation autocorrelation and soil water balance will be accounted for and not attributed to causality. Tests for GC usually specify all relevant variables in a coupled vector autoregressive (VAR) model and then calculate the significance level of decreased predictability as various coupling coefficients are omitted. But because the data (daily precipitation and soil moisture) are distinctly non-Gaussian, we avoid using a VAR and instead express the daily precipitation events as a Markov model. We then test whether the probability of storm occurrence, conditioned on past information on precipitation, changes with information on soil moisture. Past information on precipitation is expressed both as the occurrence of previous day precipitation (to account for storm-scale persistence) and as a simple soil moisture-like precipitation-wetness index derived solely from precipitation (to account for seasonal-scale persistence). In this way only those fluctuations in moisture not attributable to past fluctuations in precipitation (e.g., those due to temperature) can influence the outcome of the test. The null hypothesis (no moisture influence) is evaluated by comparing observed changes in storm probability to Monte-Carlo simulated differences generated with unconditional occurrence probabilities. The null hypothesis is not rejected (p{\textgreater}0.5) suggesting that contrary to recently published results, insufficient evidence exists to support an influence of soil moisture on precipitation in Illinois.},

	abstract = {The study of leaf anatomy and of the mechanisms of the opening and closing of stomatal guard cells leads one to suppose that the stomata constitute the main or even the sole regulating system in leaf transpiration. Meteorologists have developed a wide variety of formulae for estimating evaporation from vegetation that are based entirely on weather variables and take no account at all of the species composition or stomatal properties of the transpiring vegetation. These “potential evaporation” formulae are widely and, to a large degree, successfully used for estimating evaporation from vegetation that is not water-stressed. Transpiration depends on stomatal conductance, net radiation receipt and upon air saturation deficit, temperature, and wind speed. Saturation deficit and wind speed vary through leaf boundary layers, through canopies, and through the atmosphere above the canopies. The sensitivity of saturation deficit to changes in stomatal conductance depends on where the saturation deficit is measured. If all of the stomata on a single leaf change aperture in unison, there may be a substantial change in saturation deficit measured at the leaf surface but a negligible change in saturation deficit measured a centimetre or two away, outside the leaf boundary layer.},

The surface-atmosphere interactions are investigated based on single-column simulations of the DIurnal land-atmosphere Coupling Experiment and on global simulations. Low values of the surface thermal inertia increase the diurnal temperature range (DTR) and the daytime turbulent heat fluxes. The diurnal response of surface temperature to the thermal inertia is asymmetric between daytime and nighttime, inducing a change in the daily mean surface temperature that can reach several degrees over large areas. This asymmetrical response to thermal inertia is shown to be due to the diurnal contrast of the stability state of the atmospheric boundary layer. Thermal inertia in dry regions plays a critical role on both DTR and surface mean temperature and needs to be carefully represented in land surface models.},

In this paper, the causes of variations in coupling strength—both the geographic variations within a given model and the model-to-model differences—are addressed. The ability of soil moisture to affect precipitation is examined in two stages, namely, the ability of the soil moisture to affect evaporation, and the ability of evaporation to affect precipitation. Most of the differences between the models and within a given model are found to be associated with the first stage—an evaporation rate that varies strongly and consistently with soil moisture tends to lead to a higher coupling strength. The first-stage differences reflect identifiable differences in model parameterization and model climate. Intermodel differences in the evaporation–precipitation connection, however, also play a key role.},

This is an extension of earlier work that focused on modeling the ABL for 31 May 1978 at Cabauw, Netherlands; previously, it was found that coupled land–atmosphere tests using a simple land surface scheme did not accurately represent surface ﬂuxes and coupled ABL development. Here, ﬁndings from that earlier study on ABL parameterization are utilized, and include a more sophisticated land surface scheme. This land surface scheme allows the land–atmosphere system to respond interactively with the ABL. Results indicate that in coupled land–atmosphere model runs, realistic daytime surface ﬂuxes and atmospheric proﬁles are produced, even in the presence of ABL clouds (shallow cumulus). Subsequently, the role of soil moisture in the development of ABL clouds is explored in terms of a new relative humidity tendency equation at the ABL top where a number of processes and interactions are involved. Among other issues, it is shown that decreasing soil moisture may actually lead to an increase in ABL clouds in some cases.},

The 12 AGCM groups participating in GLACE performed a series of simple numerical experiments that allow the objective quantification of this element for boreal summer. The derived coupling strengths vary widely. Some similarity, however, is found in the spatial patterns generated by the models, with enough similarity to pinpoint multimodel “hot spots” of land–atmosphere coupling. For boreal summer, such hot spots for precipitation and temperature are found over large regions of Africa, central North America, and India; a hot spot for temperature is also found over eastern China. The design of the GLACE simulations are described in full detail so that any interested modeling group can repeat them easily and thereby place their model’s coupling strength within the broad range of those documented here.},

	abstract = {The prediction of water resource evolution is considered to be a major challenge for the coming century, particularly in the context of climate change and increasing demographic pressure. Water resources are directly linked to the continental water cycle, and the main processes modulating changes can be represented by global hydrological models. However, anthropogenic impacts on water resources, and in particular the effects of dams-reservoirs on river flows, are still poorly known and generally neglected in coupled land surface–river routing models. This paper presents a parameterized reservoir model, DROP (Dam-Reservoir OPeration), based on Hanasaki's scheme to compute monthly releases given inflows, water demands and the management purpose. With its significantly anthropized river basins, Spain has been chosen as a study case for which simulated outflows and water storage variations are evaluated against in situ observations over the period 1979–2014. Using a default configuration of the reservoir model, results reveal its positive contribution in representing the seasonal cycle of discharge and storage variation, specifically for large-storage capacity irrigation reservoirs. Based on a bounded version of the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) index, called C2M, the overall outflow representation is improved by 43 \% in the median. For irrigation reservoirs, the improvement rate reaches 80 \%. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis of DROP model parameters was conducted based on the performance of C2M on outflows and volumes using the Sobol method. The results show that the most influential parameter is the threshold coefficient describing the demand-controlled release level. The analysis also reveals the parameters that need to be focused on in order to improve river flow or reservoir water storage modeling by highlighting the difference in the individual effects of the parameters and their interactions depending on whether one focuses on outflows or volume mean seasonal patterns. The results of this generic reservoir scheme show promise for modeling present and future reservoir impacts on the continental hydrology within global land surface–river routing models.},

	abstract = {Newtonian relaxation applied at boundaries of RCM (regional climate model) is a widely-used technique for climate downscaling and regional weather forecasting. It allows RCM to be nested into GCM (global climate model) and to follow the evolution of the latter. An idealized framework to mimic this general practice is constructed with the LMDZ (Laboratoire de Meteorologie Dynamique, Zoom) modelling platform and used to assess effects of the relaxation procedure. The assessment is on both synoptic variability and long-term mean. LMDZ is a global atmospheric general circulation model that can be configured as a regional model when the outside domain is relaxed to a driver. It thus plays the role of both GCM and RCM. Same physical parameterization and identical dynamical configuration are used to ensure a rigorous comparison between the two models. The experimental set-up that can be referred to as “Master (GCM) versus Slave (RCM)” considers GCM as the reference to assess the behaviour of RCM. In terms of mean climate, there are noticeable differences, not only in the border areas, but also within the domain. In terms of synoptic variability, there is a general spatial resemblance and temporal concomitance between the two models. But there is a dependence on variables, seasons, spatiotemporal scales and spatial modes of atmospheric circulation. Winter/Summer has the most/least resemblance between RCM and GCM. A better similarity occurs when atmospheric circulation manifests at large scales. Weak-correlation cases are generally remarked when the dominant circulation of the region is at smaller scales. A further experiment with identical framework but RCM in a higher resolution allows isolating the effect of relaxation from that of mesh refinement.},

	abstract = {​​​​​​​Land–atmosphere coupling (LAC) has long been studied, focusing on land surface and atmospheric boundary layer processes. However, the influence of humidity in the lower troposphere (LT), especially that above the planetary boundary layer (PBL), on LAC remains largely unexplored. In this study, we use radiosonde observations from the US Southern Great Plains (SGP) site and an entrained parcel buoyancy model to investigate the impact of LT humidity on LAC there during the warm season (May–September). We quantify the effect of LT humidity on convective buoyancy by measuring the difference between the 2–4 km vertically integrated buoyancy with the influence of background LT humidity and that without it. Our results show that, under dry soil conditions, anomalously high LT humidity is necessary to produce the buoyancy profiles required for afternoon precipitation events (APEs). These APEs under dry soil moisture cannot be explained by commonly used local LAC indices such as the convective triggering potential and low-level humidity index (CTP / HILow), which do not account for the influence of the LT humidity. On the other hand, consideration of LT humidity is unnecessary to explain APEs under wet soil moisture conditions, suggesting that the boundary layer moisture alone could be sufficient to generate the required buoyancy profiles. These findings highlight the need to consider the impact of LT humidity, which is often decoupled from the humidity near the surface and is largely controlled by moisture transport, in understanding land–atmospheric feedbacks under dry soil conditions, especially during droughts or dry spells over the SGP.},

	abstract = {The Iberian Peninsula is prone to drought due to the high variability in the Mediterranean climate with severe consequences for drinking water supply, agriculture, hydropower and ecosystem functioning. Because of the complexity and relevance of droughts in this region, it is necessary to increase our understanding of the temporal interactions of precipitation, evapotranspiration and soil moisture that originate from drought within the Ebro basin, in northeastern Spain, as the study region. Remote sensing and land-surface models provide high-spatial-resolution and high-temporal-resolution data to characterize evapotranspiration and soil moisture anomalies in detail. The increasing availability of these datasets has the potential to overcome the lack of in situ observations of evapotranspiration and soil moisture. In this study, remote sensing data of evapotranspiration from MOD16A2 and soil moisture data from SMOS1km as well as SURFEX-ISBA land-surface model data are used to calculate the evapotranspiration deficit index (ETDI) and the soil moisture deficit index (SMDI) for the period 2010–2017. The study compares the remote sensing time series of the ETDI and SMDI with the ones estimated using the land-surface model SURFEX-ISBA, including the standardized precipitation index (SPI) computed at a weekly scale. The study focuses on the analysis of the time lags between the indices to identify the synchronicity and memory of the anomalies between precipitation, evapotranspiration and soil moisture. Lag analysis results demonstrate the capabilities of the SPI, ETDI and SMDI drought indices computed at a weekly scale to give information about the mechanisms of drought propagation at distinct levels of the land–atmosphere system. Relevant feedback for both antecedent and subsequent conditions is identified, with a preeminent role of evapotranspiration in the link between rainfall and soil moisture. Both remote sensing and the land-surface model show capability to characterize drought events, with specific advantages and drawbacks of the remote sensing and land-surface model datasets. Results underline the value of analyzing drought with dedicated indices, preferably at a weekly scale, to better identify the quick self-intensifying and mitigating mechanisms governing drought, which are relevant for drought monitoring in semi-arid areas.},

	abstract = {The Land Surface Interactions with the Atmosphere over the Iberian Semi-arid Environment (LIAISE) campaign examined the impact of anthropization on the water cycle in terms of land–atmosphere–hydrology interactions. The objective of this study is to assess the effects of irrigation on the atmosphere and on precipitation in Weather Research and Forecasting model simulations during the LIAISE special observation period in July 2021. Comparisons between simulations and observations show better verification scores for air temperature, humidity, and wind speed and direction when the model included the irrigation parametrization, improving the model warm and dry bias at 2 m over irrigated areas. Other changes found are the weakening of the sea breeze circulation and a more realistic surface energy partitioning representation. The boundary-layer height is lowered in the vicinity of irrigated areas, causing a decrease in the lifting condensation level and the level of free convection, which induce increases in convective available potential energy and convective inhibition. Precipitation differences between simulations become relevant for smaller areas, close to the irrigated land. When convection is parametrized, simulations including irrigation tend to produce a decrease in rainfall (negative feedback), whereas convection-permitting simulations produce an increase (positive feedback), although the latter underestimates substantially the observed precipitation field. In addition, irrigation activation decreases the areas exceeding moderate hourly precipitation intensities in all simulations. There is a local impact of irrigated land on model-resolved precipitation accumulations and intensities, although including the irrigation parametrization did not improve the representation of the observed precipitation field, as probably the precipitation systems during the LIAISE special observation period in July 2021 were mostly driven by larger scale perturbations or mesoscale systems, more than by local processes. Results reported here not only contribute to enhance our understanding of irrigation effects upon precipitation but also demonstrate the need to include irrigation parametrizations in numerical forecasts to overcome the biases found.},

This work aims to investigate the capabilities of the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model in a large-sample application focused on the joint integration of streamflow and evaporation data for 189 headwater catchments located in Spain. The study has been articulated into three parts: (1) a regional sensitivity analysis for a total of 20 soil, routing and vegetation parameters to select the most important parameters conducive to an adequate representation of the streamflow and evaporation dynamics; (2) a two-fold calibration approach against daily streamflow and monthly evaporation data based on the previous parameter selection for VIC, and (3) an evaluation of model performance based on a benchmark comparison against a well-established hydrologic model for the Spanish domain and a cross-validation test using multiple meteorological datasets to assess the generalizability of the calibrated parameters. The regional sensitivity analysis revealed that only two vegetation parameters \&ndash; namely, the leaf area index and the minimum stomatal resistance \&ndash; were sufficient to improve the performance of VIC for evaporation. These parameters were added to the soil and routing parameter during the calibration stage. Results from the two calibration experiments suggested that, while the streamflow performance remained close in both cases, the evaporation performance was highly improved if the objectives for streamflow and evaporation were combined into a single composite function during optimization. The VIC model outperfomed the reference benchmark and the independent meteorological datasets yielded a slight to moderate loss in model performance depending on the calibration experiment considered. This investigation will help gain a better understanding of the hydrology of the Spanish catchments and will help prepare the ground for a fully gridded implementation of the VIC model in Spain.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The mean squared error (MSE) and the related normalization, the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), are the two criteria most widely used for calibration and evaluation of hydrological models with observed data. Here, we present a diagnostically interesting decomposition of NSE (and hence MSE), which facilitates analysis of the relative importance of its different components in the context of hydrological modelling, and show how model calibration problems can arise due to interactions among these components. The analysis is illustrated by calibrating a simple conceptual precipitation-runoff model to daily data for a number of Austrian basins having a broad range of hydro-meteorological characteristics. Evaluation of the results clearly demonstrates the problems that can be associated with any calibration based on the NSE (or MSE) criterion. While we propose and test an alternative criterion that can help to reduce model calibration problems, the primary purpose of this study is not to present an improved measure of model performance. Instead, we seek to show that there are systematic problems inherent with any optimization based on formulations related to the MSE. The analysis and results have implications to the manner in which we calibrate and evaluate environmental models; we discuss these and suggest possible ways forward that may move us towards an improved and diagnostically meaningful approach to model performance evaluation and identification.},

	abstract = {The number and refinement of gridded meteorological datasets are on the rise at the global and regional scales. Although these datasets are now commonly used for hydrological modeling, the representation of precipitation amount and timing is crucial to correctly model streamflow. The Genie Rural à 4 paramètres journalier (GR4J) conceptual hydrological model combined with the CEMANEIGE snow routine was calibrated using four temperature and precipitation datasets [Système d’analyse fournissant des renseignements atmospheriques à la neige (SAFRAN), Mesoscale Analysis (MESAN), E-OBS, and Water and Global Change (WATCH) Forcing Data ERA-Interim (WFDEI)] on 931 French gauged catchments ranging in size from 10 to 10 000 km2. The efficiency of the calibrated hydrological model in simulating streamflow was higher for the models calibrated on high-resolution meteorological datasets (SAFRAN, MESAN) compared to coarse-resolution datasets (E-OBS, WFDEI), as well as for reanalysis (SAFRAN, MESAN, WFDEI) compared to datasets based on interpolation only (E-OBS). The systematic decrease in efficiency associated with precipitation bias or temporality highlights that the use of a hydrological model calibrated on meteorological datasets can assess these datasets, most particularly precipitation. It appears essential that datasets account for high-resolution topography to accurately represent elevation gradients and assimilate dense ground-based observation networks. This is particularly emphasized for hydrological applications in mountainous areas and areas subject to finescale events. For hydrological applications on nonmountainous regions, not subject to finescale events, both regional and global datasets give satisfactory results. It is crucial to continue improving precipitation datasets, especially in mountainous areas, and to assess their sensitivity to eventual corrupted observations. These datasets are essential to correct the bias of climate model outputs and to investigate the impact of climate change on hydrological regimes.},

	abstract = {Despite many years of extensive research, the evolution of Tropical Cyclone (TC) activity in our changing climate remains uncertain. This is partly because the answer to that question relies primarily on climate simulations with horizontal resolutions of a few tens of kilometers. Such simulations have only recently become accessible for most modeling centers, including the Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace (IPSL). Using recent numerical developments in the IPSL model, we perform a series of historical atmospheric-only simulations that follow the HighResMIP protocol. We assess the impact of increasing the resolution from \$\$\{{\textbackslash}sim \}{\textbackslash}, 200\$\$to 25 km on TC activity. In agreement with previous work, we find a systematic improvement of TC activity with increasing resolution with respect to the observations. However, a clear signature of TC frequencies convergence with resolution is still lacking. Cyclogenesis geographical distributions also improve at the scale of individual basins. This is particularly true of the North Atlantic, where the agreement with the observed distribution is impressive at 25 km. In agreement with the observations, TC activity correlates with the large-scale environment and ENSO in that basin. By contrast, TC frequencies remain too small in the Western North Pacific at 25 km, where significant biases of humidity and vorticity are found compared to the reanalysis. Despite the few minor weaknesses we identified, our results demonstrate that the IPSL model is a suitable tool for studying TCs on climate time scales. This work thus opens the way for further studies contributing to our understanding of TC climatology.},

Based on 10 CPM simulations and 9 coarser-resolution model simulations, we quantify contributions from evaporative fraction (EF) and radiation to the T2m bias with both types of models overestimating T2m largely because they underestimate EF. The performance of CPMs in capturing MCS characteristics (frequency, rainfall, propagation) varies. The pre-summer precipitation bias has large correlation with mean summertime T2m bias but the relationship between summertime MCS mean rainfall bias and T2m bias is non-monotonic. Analysis of lifting condensation level deficit and convective available potential energy suggests that models with T2m warm biases and low EF have too dry and stable boundary layers, inhibiting the formation of clouds, precipitation and MCSs. Among the CPMs with differing model formulations (e.g., transpiration, infiltration, cloud macrophysics and microphysics), evidence suggests that altering the land-surface model is more effective than altering the atmospheric model in reducing T2m biases. These results demonstrate that land-atmosphere interactions play a very important role in determining the summertime climate of the Central United States.},

Prior research has demonstrated that parameter uncertainty drives uncertainty in land surface fluxes. However, the influence of land process uncertainty on the climate system remains underexplored. Here, we quantify how assumptions about land processes impact climate using a perturbed parameter ensemble for 18 land parameters in the Community Earth System Model version 2 under preindustrial conditions. We find that an observationally-informed range of land parameters generate biogeophysical feedbacks that significantly influence the mean climate state, largely by modifying evapotranspiration. Global mean land surface temperature ranges by 2.2°C across our ensemble (σ = 0.5°C) and precipitation changes were significant and spatially variable. Our analysis demonstrates that the impacts of land parameter uncertainty on surface fluxes propagate to the entire Earth system, and provides insights into where and how land process uncertainty influences climate.},

	abstract = {Uncertainties in the climate response to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentrations are quantified in a perturbed land surface parameter experiment. The ensemble of 108 members is constructed by systematically perturbing five poorly constrained land surface parameters of global climate model individually and in all possible combinations. The land surface parameters induce small uncertainties at global scale, substantial uncertainties at regional and seasonal scale and very large uncertainties in the tails of the distribution, the climate extremes. Climate sensitivity varies across the ensemble mainly due to the perturbation of the snow albedo parameterization, which controls the snow albedo feedback strength. The uncertainty range in the global response is small relative to perturbed physics experiments focusing on atmospheric parameters. However, land surface parameters are revealed to control the response not only of the mean but also of the variability of temperature. Major uncertainties are identified in the response of climate extremes to a doubling of CO2. During winter the response both of temperature mean and daily variability relates to fractional snow cover. Cold extremes over high latitudes warm disproportionately in ensemble members with strong snow albedo feedback and large snow cover reduction. Reduced snow cover leads to more winter warming and stronger variability decrease. As a result uncertainties in mean and variability response line up, with some members showing weak and others very strong warming of the cold tail of the distribution, depending on the snow albedo parametrization. The uncertainty across the ensemble regionally exceeds the CMIP3 multi-model range. Regarding summer hot extremes, the uncertainties are larger than for mean summer warming but smaller than in multi-model experiments. The summer precipitation response to a doubling of CO2 is not robust over many regions. Land surface parameter perturbations and natural variability alter the sign of the response even over subtropical regions.},

Surface properties control the partitioning of energy within the surface energy budget to fluxes of shortwave and longwave radiation, sensible and latent heat, and ground heat storage. Changes in surface energy fluxes can impact the atmosphere across scales through changes in temperature, cloud cover, and large-scale atmospheric circulation. We test the sensitivity of the atmosphere to global changes in three land surface properties: albedo, evaporative resistance, and surface roughness. We show the impact of changing these surface properties differs drastically between simulations run with an offline land model, compared to coupled land–atmosphere simulations that allow for atmospheric feedbacks associated with land–atmosphere coupling. Atmospheric feedbacks play a critical role in defining the temperature response to changes in albedo and evaporative resistance, particularly in the extratropics. More than 50\% of the surface temperature response to changing albedo comes from atmospheric feedbacks in over 80\% of land areas. In some regions, cloud feedbacks in response to increased evaporative resistance result in nearly 1 K of additional surface warming. In contrast, the magnitude of surface temperature responses to changes in vegetation height are comparable between offline and coupled simulations. We improve our fundamental understanding of how and why changes in vegetation cover drive responses in the atmosphere, and develop understanding of the role of individual land surface properties in controlling climate across spatial scales—critical to understanding the effects of land-use change on Earth’s climate.},

This paper quantifies land–atmosphere interactions over irrigated and nonirrigated land uses during the Great Plains Irrigation Experiment (GRAINEX). Three coupling metrics were used to quantify land–atmosphere interactions as they relate to convection. They include the convective triggering potential (CTP), the low-level humidity index (HIlow), and the lifting condensation level (LCL) deficit. These metrics were calculated from the rawinsonde data obtained from the Integrated Sounding Systems (ISSs) for Rogers Farm and York Airport along with soundings launched from the three Doppler on Wheels (DOW) sites. Each metric was categorized by intensive observation period (IOP), cloud cover, and time of day. Results show that with higher CTP, lower HIlow, and lower LCL deficit, conditions were more favorable for convective development over irrigated land use. When metrics were grouped and analyzed by IOP, compared to nonirrigated land use, HIlow was found to be lower for irrigated land use, suggesting favorable conditions for convective development. Furthermore, when metrics were grouped and analyzed by clear and nonclear days, CTP values were higher over irrigated cropland than nonirrigated land use. In addition, compared to nonirrigated land use, the LCL deficit during the peak growing season was lower over irrigated land use, suggesting a favorable condition for convection. It is found that with the transition from the early summer to the mid/peak summer and increased irrigation, the environment became more favorable for convective development over irrigated land use. Finally, it was found that regardless of background atmospheric conditions, irrigated land use provided a favorable environment for convective development.},

However, there has been lack of observational data–based studies solely focused on impacts of irrigation on the PBL and convective conditions. The Great Plains Irrigation Experiment (GRAINEX), conducted during the 2018 growing season, collected data over irrigated and nonirrigated land uses over Nebraska to understand these impacts. Specifically, the objective was to determine whether the impacts of irrigation are sustained throughout the growing season. The data analyzed include latent and sensible heat flux, air temperature, dewpoint temperature, equivalent temperature (moist enthalpy), PBL height, lifting condensation level (LCL), level of free convection (LFC), and PBL mixing ratio. Results show increased partitioning of energy into latent heat relative to sensible heat over irrigated areas while average maximum air temperature was decreased and dewpoint temperature was increased from the early to peak growing season. Radiosonde data suggest reduced planetary boundary layer (PBL) heights at all launch sites from the early to peak growing season. However, reduction of PBL height was much greater over irrigated areas than over nonirrigated croplands. Relative to the early growing period, LCL and LFC heights were also lower during the peak growing period over irrigated areas. Results note, for the first time, that the impacts of irrigation on PBL evolution and convective environment can be sustained throughout the growing season and regardless of background atmospheric conditions. These are important findings and applicable to other irrigated areas in the world. Significance Statement To meet the ever-increasing demand for food, many regions of the world have adopted widespread irrigation. The High Plains Aquifer (HPA) region, located within the Great Plains of the United States, is one of the most extensively irrigated regions. In this study, for the first time, we have conducted a detailed irrigation-focused land surface and atmospheric data collection campaign to determine irrigation impacts on the atmosphere. This research demonstrates that irrigation significantly alters lower atmospheric characteristics and creates favorable cloud and convection development conditions during the growing season. The results clearly show first-order impacts of irrigation on regional weather and climate and hence warrant further attention so that we can minimize negative impacts and achieve sustainable irrigation.},

It has also been proposed that additional rainfall generated by the lake would spread beyond the lake itself, potentially opening up large tracts of uncultivated land to dryland agriculture. Here we use a climate model to examine how adding a permanent lake to Australia's arid center might influence local and regional precipitation. Locally, evaporative cooling from the lake increases low-level divergence, suppressing precipitation. Regionally, additional moisture from the lake is spread thinly over the Australian continent, resulting in little change to total precipitation. Overall, our results do not support the assertion that maintaining a large inland lake like Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre in central Australia would significantly increase precipitation, either locally or regionally.},

Furthermore, on highly anthropized basins, it is essential to anchor the analysis to reliable Q measurements. Gauge networks are however very sparse and limited in time, and SWOT (Surface Water Ocean Topography) river discharge estimates at global scale are not yet available. The method proposed here is able to obtain continuous daily Q estimates at 1 km/daily resolution, using indirect satellite data and ground-based estimates. We focus here on the Ebro. Over such an anthropized basin (e.g. change of land use, irrigation), the exploitation of 205 available gauges at their nominal resolution (i.e., daily point measurements) is a necessity. The hydrological Continuum model is used to help interpolate spatially and temporally the observations into our optimal interpolation scheme. The proposed Q-mapping is similar to an assimilation scheme were Earth observations (precipitation, evapotranspiration and total water storage change) and model simulations are constrained by in situ gauge measurements. The Q estimates are evaluated using a rigorous leave-one-out experiment, showing a good agreement with the in situ data: a correlation of 0.72 (median), and a 75th percentile of Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency up to 0.62. Our spatio-temporal continuous Q estimates at high spatial/temporal resolution can describe complex continental water dynamics, including extreme events. SWOT estimates will soon be available, at the global scale but with irregular space/time sampling: our method should help exploit them to obtain a regular space-temporal description of the water cycle at high resolution.},

	abstract = {Climate change and evolving water management practices may have a significant impact on hydropower generation. While hydrological models have been widely used to assess these effects, they often present some limitations. A major challenge lies in modeling the release decisions for hydropower reservoirs, which result from intricate trade-offs, involving power sector dispatch, competing water uses, and the spatial allocation of power generation within the grid.

 To address this gap, this study introduces a novel demand-based approach for integrating hydropower within the routing module of land surface models. First, hydropower infrastructures are located in coherence with the hydrological network, and links are built between hydropower plants and their supplying reservoirs to explicitly represent water transfers built for hydropower generation. Then, coordinated dam operation is simulated by distributing a prescribed electric demand to be satisfied by hydropower across the different power plants within the power grid, while considering the operational constraints associated with the multipurpose nature of most dams.

 To validate this approach, we implement the framework within the water transport scheme of a land surface model and assess it with the case study of the French electrical system. We drive the model with a high-resolution atmospheric reanalysis and prescribe the observed national hydropower production as the total power demand to be met by hydropower infrastructures. By comparing the simulated evolution of reservoir stocks to observations, we find that the model simulates realistic operations of reservoirs and successfully satisfies hydropower production demands over the entire period. We also highlight the roles of uncertainties in estimated precipitation and of the limited knowledge of hydropower infrastructure in the estimation of production. Finally, we show that such an integration of hydropower operations in the model improves the simulations of river discharges in mountainous catchments affected by hydropower.},

	abstract = {Assessing past distributions, variability and trends in the mountain snow cover and its first-order drivers, temperature and precipitation, is key for a wide range of studies and applications. In this study, we compare the results of various modeling systems (global and regional reanalyses ERA5, ERA5-Land, ERA5-Crocus, CERRA-Land, UERRA MESCAN-SURFEX and MTMSI and regional climate model simulations CNRM-ALADIN and CNRM-AROME driven by the global reanalysis ERA-Interim) against observational references (in situ, gridded observational datasets and satellite observations) across the European Alps from 1950 to 2020. The comparisons are performed in terms of monthly and seasonal snow cover variables (snow depth and snow cover duration) and their main atmospherical drivers (near-surface temperature and precipitation). We assess multi-annual averages of regional and subregional mean values, their interannual variations, and trends over various timescales, mainly for the winter period (from November through April).

 ERA5, ERA5-Crocus, MESCAN-SURFEX, CERRA-Land and MTMSI offer a satisfying description of the monthly snow evolution. However, a spatial comparison against satellite observation indicates that all datasets overestimate the snow cover duration, especially the melt-out date. CNRM-AROME and CNRM-ALADIN simulations and ERA5-Land exhibit an overestimation of the snow accumulation during winter, increasing with elevations.

 The analysis of the interannual variability and trends indicates that modeling snow cover dynamics remains complex across multiple scales and that none of the models evaluated here fully succeed to reproduce this compared to observational reference datasets. Indeed, while most of the evaluated model outputs perform well at representing the interannual to multi-decadal winter temperature and precipitation variability, they often fail to address the variability in the snow depth and snow cover duration. We discuss several artifacts potentially responsible for incorrect long-term climate trends in several reanalysis products (ERA5 and MESCAN-SURFEX), which we attribute primarily to the heterogeneities of the observation datasets assimilated.

 Nevertheless, many of the considered datasets in this study exhibit past trends in line with the current state of knowledge. Based on these datasets, over the last 50 years (1968–2017) at a regional scale, the European Alps have experienced a winter warming of 0.3 to 0.4 ∘C per decade, stronger at lower elevations, and a small reduction in winter precipitation, homogeneous with elevation. The decline in the winter snow depth and snow cover duration ranges from −7 \% to −15 \% per decade and from −5 to −7 d per decade, respectively, both showing a larger decrease at low and intermediate elevations.

 Overall, we show that no modeling strategy outperforms all others within our sample and that upstream choices (horizontal resolution, heterogeneity of the observations used for data assimilation in reanalyses, coupling between surface and atmosphere, level of complexity, configuration of the snow scheme, etc.) have great consequences on the quality of the datasets and their potential use. Despite their limitations, in many cases they can be used to characterize the main features of the mountain snow cover for a range of applications.},

	abstract = {Human land use activities have resulted in large changes to the biogeochemical and biophysical properties of the Earth's surface, with consequences for climate and other ecosystem services. In the future, land use activities are likely to expand and/or intensify further to meet growing demands for food, fiber, and energy. As part of the World Climate Research Program Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), the international community has developed the next generation of advanced Earth system models (ESMs) to estimate the combined effects of human activities (e.g., land use and fossil fuel emissions) on the carbon–climate system. A new set of historical data based on the History of the Global Environment database (HYDE), and multiple alternative scenarios of the future (2015–2100) from Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) teams, is required as input for these models. With most ESM simulations for CMIP6 now completed, it is important to document the land use patterns used by those simulations. Here we present results from the Land-Use Harmonization 2 (LUH2) project, which smoothly connects updated historical reconstructions of land use with eight new future projections in the format required for ESMs. The harmonization strategy estimates the fractional land use patterns, underlying land use transitions, key agricultural management information, and resulting secondary lands annually, while minimizing the differences between the end of the historical reconstruction and IAM initial conditions and preserving changes depicted by the IAMs in the future. The new approach builds on a similar effort from CMIP5 and is now provided at higher resolution (0.25∘×0.25∘) over a longer time domain (850–2100, with extensions to 2300) with more detail (including multiple crop and pasture types and associated management practices) using more input datasets (including Landsat remote sensing data) and updated algorithms (wood harvest and shifting cultivation); it is assessed via a new diagnostic package. The new LUH2 products contain \&gt;\&thinsp;50 times the information content of the datasets used in CMIP5 and are designed to enable new and improved estimates of the combined effects of land use on the global carbon–climate system.},

	abstract = {This study evaluates the ability of 15 CMIP6 global climate models (GCMs), dynamically downscaled to a 9-km grid, to effectively simulate the observed regional hydroclimate across the complex terrain of the western United States. The evaluation focuses on orographic precipitation, surface temperature, and snow water equivalent (SWE), evaluated over a 33-yr period (1981–2014) using gridded gauge- and station-based datasets and a snowpack reanalysis product. Additional comparisons are made against two ERA5-driven climate reconstructions: one at 9-km resolution, with the same physical choices, and one at 4-km resolution. The latter better captures the terrain and orographic processes and uses different physics. Model performance is evaluated in four geographic regions, and mountains are contrasted against the surrounding plains. The evaluation is challenged by the fact that gridded observational estimates of climate parameters in complex terrain have a poorly quantified uncertainty related to measurement and/or representativeness issues. The ensemble mean of the downscaled GCMs overestimates cold-season precipitation, its orographic enhancement, and peak SWE in the mountains. Its diurnal temperature cycle and its mountain–plain temperature contrast are suppressed, compared to observations: its temperature estimates err toward the mean on both sides of both distributions. But the same applies to the identically downscaled (9 km) ERA5, indicating that these biases are due to model physics, not a misrepresentation of the climate system. The 4-km ERA5-based reconstruction has smaller biases in terms of precipitation and temperature, especially over mountains, but underestimates SWE. Model performance differs between mountains and plains, and the differences vary by region. Significance Statement In the western United States, much of the precipitation contributing to streamflow falls over mountains. In addition, the mountain snowpack seasonally stores water for consumptive use in the warm season. Amid growing concerns about changing water availability associated with the changing hydrometeorological patterns in a warming climate, it is essential to evaluate how well climate models capture precipitation and the snowpack across the headwater regions. Dynamically downscaled CMIP6 models, on average, capture the historical climate quite well, but uncertainty remains about how well they capture key climate parameters over the mountains. This uncertainty is due, in part, to the paucity of measurements in the mountains. Here, we demonstrate that dynamic downscaling to finer grid resolutions reduces this uncertainty.},

In the case of horizontally uniform perturbations, we find a consistently positive soil moisture-precipitation feedback, irrespective of the presence of low orography. On the other hand, a negative feedback emerges with localized perturbations: a dry soil heterogeneity substantially enhances rain amounts that scale linearly with the dryness of the soil, while a moist heterogeneity suppresses rain amounts. If the heterogeneity is located in a mountainous region, the relative importance of soil moisture heterogeneity decreases with increasing mountain height: A mountain 500 m in height is sufficient to neutralize the local soil moisture-precipitation feedback.},

	abstract = {The importance of soil moisture anomalies on airmass convection over semiarid regions has been recognized in several studies. The underlying mechanisms remain partly unclear. An open question is why wetter soils can result in either an increase or a decrease of precipitation (positive or negative soil moisture–precipitation feedback, respectively). Here an idealized cloud-resolving modeling framework is used to explore the local soil moisture–precipitation feedback. The approach is able to replicate both positive and negative feedback loops, depending on the environmental parameters. The mechanism relies on horizontal soil moisture variations, which may develop and intensify spontaneously. The positive expression of the feedback is associated with the initiation of convection over dry soil patches, but the convective cells then propagate over wet patches where they strengthen and preferentially precipitate. The negative feedback may occur when the wind profile is too weak to support the propagation of convective features from dry to wet areas. Precipitation is then generally weaker and falls preferentially over dry patches. The results highlight the role of the midtropospheric flow in determining the sign of the feedback. A key element of the positive feedback is the exploitation of both low convective inhibition (CIN) over dry patches (for the initiation of convection) and high CAPE over wet patches (for the generation of precipitation).},

The mesoscale atmospheric model Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS) is used to isolate the effects of subsurface heterogeneity, terrain, and soil moisture initialization. The simulations are initialized with detailed soil moisture distributions obtained from offline spin-ups using a coupled surface-subsurface model (ParFlow-CLM). In these idealized simulations, we observe that terrain effects dominate the planetary boundary layer (PBL) development during early morning hours, while the soil moisture signature overcomes that of terrain during the afternoon. Water table and subsurface properties produce a similar effect as that of soil moisture as their signatures (reflected in soil moisture profiles, energy fluxes, and evaporation at the land surface) can also overcome that of terrain during afternoon hours. This is mostly clear for land surface energy fluxes and evaporation at the land surface. We also observe the coupling between water table depth and planetary boundary layer depth in our cases is strongest within wet-to-dry transition zones. This extends the findings of previous studies which demonstrate the subsurface connection to surface energy fluxes is strongest in such transition zones. We investigate how this connection extends into the atmosphere and can affect the structure and development of the convective boundary layer.},

	abstract = {Feedbacks between soil moisture and precipitation are important for understanding hydroclimatic variability in many regions. However, much uncertainty remains about how land surface fluxes influence the initiation of deep convection locally. While some studies consider only atmospheric and soil profiles, in a one-dimensional sense, others have argued that horizontal variability in fluxes plays an important role in convective triggering, via mesoscale circulations. This paper presents the first comprehensive observational analysis over Europe linking convective initiation to soil moisture, based on satellite observations of cloud top and land surface temperature, and soil moisture. The results show that convective initiations are favored on the downwind side of dry surfaces, close to wetter areas. The signal is clearest following dry periods and under light winds, consistent with forcing by a mesoscale circulation. Overall, the detected signal in Europe is weaker than in previous Sahelian analysis, but key spatial characteristics are essentially the same.},

	abstract = {The transport of water, heat, and momentum from the surface to the atmosphere is dependent, in part, on the characteristics of the land surface. Along with the model physics, parameterization schemes, and parameters employed, land datasets determine the spatial variability in land surface states (i.e., soil moisture and temperature) and fluxes. Despite the importance of these datasets, they are often chosen out of convenience or owing to regional limitations, without due assessment of their impacts on model results. Irrigation is an anthropogenic form of land heterogeneity that has been shown to alter the land surface energy balance, ambient weather, and local circulations. As such, irrigation schemes are becoming more prevalent in weather and climate models, with rapid developments in dataset availability and parameterization scheme complexity. Thus, to address pragmatic issues related to modeling irrigation, this study uses a high-resolution, regional coupled modeling system to investigate the impacts of irrigation dataset selection on land–atmosphere (L–A) coupling using a case study from the Great Plains Irrigation Experiment (GRAINEX) field campaign. The simulations are assessed in the context of irrigated vs. nonirrigated regions, subregions across the irrigation gradient, and sub-grid-scale process representation in coarser-scale models. The results show that L–A coupling is sensitive to the choice of irrigation dataset and resolution and that the irrigation impact on surface fluxes and near-surface meteorology can be dominant, conditioned on the details of the irrigation map (e.g., boundaries and heterogeneity), or minimal. A consistent finding across several analyses was that even a low percentage of irrigation fraction (i.e., 4 \%–16 \%) can have significant local and downstream atmospheric impacts (e.g., lower planetary boundary layer, PBL, height), suggesting that the representation of boundaries and heterogeneous areas within irrigated regions is particularly important for the modeling of irrigation impacts on the atmosphere in this model. When viewing the simulations presented here as a proxy for “ideal” tiling in an Earth-system-model-scale grid box, the results show that some “tiles” will reach critical nonlinear moisture and PBL thresholds that could be important for clouds and convection, implying that heterogeneity resulting from irrigation should be taken into consideration in new sub-grid L–A exchange parameterizations.},

Analysis of historical daily maximum temperature (TMAX) observations showed that the three Global Historical Climate Network (GHCN) sites downwind of Columbia Basin Project (CBP) irrigation experienced statistically significant cooling of the mean summer TMAX by 0.8°–1.6°C in the post-CBP (1968–98) as compared to pre-CBP expansion (1908–38) period, opposite the background climate signal. Remote sensing observations of soil moisture and land surface temperatures in more recent years show wetter soil ({\textasciitilde}18\%–25\%) and cooler land surface temperatures over the irrigated areas. Simulations using NASA’s Land Information System (LIS) coupled to the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model support the historical analysis, confirming that under the most common summer wind flow regime, irrigation cooling can extend as far downwind as the locations of these stations. Taken together, these results suggest that irrigation expansion may have contributed to a reduction in summertime temperatures and heat extremes within and downwind of the CBP area. This supports a regional impact of irrigation across the study area.},

Previous studies discussed that the irrigation signal might depend on the geographical region as well as the synoptic and climatic conditions. The work presented here aims to investigate the mechanisms behind changes in the irrigation impact on the local conditions depending on synoptic changes. Different to previous works, this employs convection-permitting simulations. Irrigation processes are parameterized in three different ways depending on the evaporative loss. The region of focus is in northern Italy (Po Valley), which is of interest for both the soil-atmosphere coupling strength and widely used irrigation. The simulation period is Summer 2015 (May–July), which includes a heatwave month (July) and an average month (June). The results show how irrigation prevented the drying out of the soil layers during the heatwave. This influences the surface flux partition differently, by increasing moisture flux and decreasing the sensible heat flux. In general, the irrigation impact magnitude, with respect to the control simulation, is more than double in July compared to June. This study discusses climate implications for the region, such as the impact of widespread irrigation on the vegetation health, the heatwave feedback mechanism, atmospheric pollution, and human heat discomfort.},

We computed the Aridity Index, computed as the ratio of precipitation to reference evapotranspiration, over Spain for the period 1961–2020. Here we present spatially detailed climatologies of the Aridity Index, at the annual and the monthly scales, and an assessment of changes between the normal periods 1961–1990 and 1991–2020. The results show a transition towards reduced values of the Aridity Index (i.e., towards drier conditions) at the annual scale, which was more intense in the Canary Islands (where 16.3\% of the territory transitioned towards more arid climate categories) than in mainland Spain and the Balearic Islands (11.6\%). At the monthly level, the most striking changes over mainland Spain occurred in June, with 39.7\% of the territory transitioning towards more arid categories, while transitions towards more humid conditions have only been relevant in March (23.5\%) and October (13.0\%) and did not compensate for the aridification trend when the whole year is considered. In the Canary Islands, the strongest changes occurred in May (22.6\%) and September (19.4\%), although drying trends were found almost in all months except the summer.},

The great majority of freshwater consumption by human societies is associated with irrigation, which contributes to a major modification of the global water cycle by enhancing evapotranspiration and reducing surface and groundwater runoff. In many regions of the world irrigation contributes to streamflow and groundwater depletion, soil salinization, cooler microclimate conditions, and altered land-atmosphere interactions. Despite the important role played by irrigation in food security, water cycle, soil productivity, and near-surface atmospheric conditions, its global extent remains poorly quantified. To date global maps of irrigated land are often based on estimates from circa year 2000. Here we apply artificial intelligence methods based on machine learning algorithms to satellite remote sensing and monthly climate data to map the spatial extent of irrigated areas between 2001 and 2015.

Various theories have been proposed to explain these biases, but no studies have linked the biases with the missing representation of human perturbations, such as irrigation. Here we argue that neglecting the impact of irrigation contributes to the longstanding warm surface temperature and lack of precipitation biases over this region. By using convection-permitting multi-season simulations over the contiguous United States coupled with an operational-like irrigation scheme, we show that irrigation increases surface evapotranspiration and decreases surface temperature by increasing evaporative fraction. By increasing the frequency of mesoscale convective systems, irrigation reduces the summertime model precipitation deficit and improves the simulated precipitation diurnal cycle over the Great Plains. The increased precipitation also alleviates the warm bias in our simulation setup, likely by damping the positive feedback between soil moisture and temperature.},

This, together with a largely unpredictable climate and scarce water resources, resulted in a large number of hydraulic infrastructures, with more than 1000 large reservoirs spread throughout Iberian watercourses. Although climatic variation is high, most of the Iberian Peninsula is semi-arid in terms of rainfall, with a northeast to south gradient in aridity, and many streams and rivers in the Mediterranean basin are intermittent. The main Iberian rivers cross the Peninsula either east to west (Duero, Tagus, Guadiana) into the Atlantic, or west to east (Ebro) into the Mediterranean. The Iberian rivers are subject to strong hydromorphological alterations as well as widespread point-source and diffuse pollution. In addition to eutrophication in a large number of waterbodies, organic contaminants such as pesticides, and pharmaceutical and industrial products cause multiple stress and threaten a rich biodiversity. Predictions for climate change indicate that the flow regime of most Mediterranean watercourses will be affected ecologically, especially under future scenarios of increasing human land occupation.},

	abstract = {The climatic conditions of the Iberian Peninsula result in an imbalance between water availability and demand, which is largely managed through the many dams that were built during the 20th century. However, dam operations modify the natural functioning of rivers and related subsystems. In this study we investigated the effect of reservoirs on river regimes in the Duero basin, which is one of the largest river basins in Spain. This involved calculation of a modified impoundment ratio index, and assessment of the correlations between monthly inflows and outflows. Water resources in the basin have decreased markedly during the last five decades, so we also studied how patterns of management have adapted to less water availability in the region. A significant correlation was found between the level of impoundment and the alteration of river regimes by dams. The degree of regulation was highly dependent on annual inflows into the reservoir, and consequently alterations to river regimes were more intense during dry years. The basic pattern of flow regulation involved the storage of water during winter and spring in preparation for high water demand in summer, when natural flows are low. A combination of trend and cluster analyses revealed three responses of reservoir managers to decreasing inflows during the study period: (i) for several reservoirs the level of storage was reduced; (ii) for many reservoirs, particularly those for hydropower production, the storages were increased; and (iii) for the remainder the storage levels were maintained by adjusting the outflows to the decreasing inflows. The results suggest the absence of a common approach to reservoir management, and the dominance of other interests over environmental concerns, particularly in the context of hydrological change in the basin.},

	abstract = {River regulation by dams modifies flow regimes, interrupts the transfer of sediment through channel networks, and alters downstream bed dynamics, altogether affecting channel form and processes. So far, most studies on the geomorphic impacts of dams are restricted to single rivers, or even single river stretches. In this paper we analyse the geomorphic status of 74 river sites distributed across four large basins in the Iberian Peninsula (i.e. 47 sites located downstream of dams). For this purpose, we combine field data with hydrological data available from water agencies, and analyse historical (1970) and current aerial photographs. In particular, we have developed a Geomorphic Status (GS) index that allows us to assess the physical structure of a given channel reach and its change through time. The GS encompasses a determination of changes in sedimentary units, sediment availability, bar stability and channel flow capacity. Sites are statistically grouped in four clusters based on contrasted physical and climate characteristics. Results emphasise that regulation changes river's flow regime with a generalized reduction of the magnitude and frequency of floods (thus flow competence). This, in addition to the decrease downstream sediment supply, results in the loss of active bars as they are encroached by vegetation, to the point that only reaches with little or no regulation maintain exposed sedimentary deposits. The GS of regulated river reaches is negatively correlated with magnitude of the impoundment (regulation). Heavily impacted reaches present channel stabilization and, in contrast to the hydrological response, the distance and number of tributaries do not reverse the geomorphic impact of the dams. Stabilization limits river dynamics and may contribute to the environmental degradation of the fluvial ecosystem. Overall, results describe the degree of geomorphological alteration experienced by representative Iberian rivers mostly because of regulation, challenging the successful long-term implementation of river basin management programmes.},

	abstract = {The aim of this article is to test the sensitivity of the West African hydrological cycle to infiltration processes and to river reinfiltration pathways. This is done through sensitivity experiments to both inputs and paramterization settings of the ORCHIDEE Land-Surface Model. The parameterizations to take into account the effects of flat areas, ponds and floodplains on surface infiltration, and the effect of roots and deep-soil compactness on infiltration are first described. The sensitivity analysis to parameterization settings shows that the surface infiltration processes have a stronger impact in the soudano-sahelian region and more generally in semi-arid African regions, whereas the rootzone and deep-soil infiltration also play a role in the guinean and intermediate regions between arid and humid ones. In the equatorial and semi-humid regions, infiltration processes generally play a minor role. The infiltration parameterizations may explain part of the difference between simulated and observed river discharge in semi-arid and intermediate basins. The sensitivity analysis to the Land-Surface Model inputs shows that different sources of uncertainty might also explain part of the error. Indeed, the precipitation forcing in the whole West African region, the long-term storage in the soudano-sahelian region, the soil types in the guinean region and the vegetation types in the equatorial region are significant sources of errors. Therefore, observations and analyses of small scale infiltration processes as well as continuous measurements of river discharges in West Africa are essential to ensure the reliability of future calibration for the infiltration parameterizations.},

	abstract = {A simple analytic model is proposed which predicts the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity curves by using the moisture content-capillary head curve and the measured value of the hydraulic conductivity at saturation. It is similar to the Childs and Collis-George (1950) model but uses a modified assumption concerning the hydraulic conductivity of the pore sequence in order to take into account the effect of the larger pore section. A computational method is derived for the determination of the residual water content and for the extrapolation of the water content-capillary head curve as measured in a limited range. The proposed model is compared with the existing practical models of Averjanov (1950), Wyllie and Gardner (1958), and Millington and Quirk (1961) on the basis of the measured data of 45 soils. It seems that the new model is in better agreement with observations.},

	abstract = {A new and relatively simple equation for the soil-water content-pressure head curve, θ(h), is described in this paper. The particular form of the equation enables one to derive closed-form analytical expressions for the relative hydraulic conductivity, Kr, when substituted in the predictive conductivity models of N.T. Burdine or Y. Mualem. The resulting expressions for Kr(h) contain three independent parameters which may be obtained by fitting the proposed soil-water retention model to experimental data. Results obtained with the closed-form analytical expressions based on the Mualem theory are compared with observed hydraulic conductivity data for five soils with a wide range of hydraulic properties. The unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is predicted well in four out of five cases. It is found that a reasonable description of the soil-water retention curve at low water contents is important for an accurated prediction of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity.},

	abstract = {The parameterization of continental evaporation in many atmospheric general circulation models (GCMS) used for simulation of climate is demonstrably inconsistent with the empirical work upon which the parameterization is based. In the turbulent transfer relation for potential evaporation, the climate models employ the modeled actual temperature to evaluate the saturated surface humidity, whereas the consistent temperature is the one reflecting cooling by the hypothetical potential evaporation. A simple theoretical analysis and some direct computations, all ignoring atmospheric feedbacks, indicate that whenever the soil moisture is limited, GCM-based climate models produce rates of potential evaporation that exceed, by a factor of two or more, the rates that would be yielded by use of the consistent temperature. Further approximate analyses and supporting numerical simulations indicate that the expected value of dry-season soil moisture has a short memory relative to the annual cycle and that dry-season evaporation is therefore nearly equal to dry-season precipitation. When potential evaporation is overestimated, it follows that the soil moisture is artificially reduced by a similar factor, and actual evaporation may or may not be overestimated, depending on other details of the hydrologic parameterization. These arguments, advanced on theoretical grounds, explain the substantial, systematic differences between GCM-generated and observation-based estimates of potential evaporation rates and call into question the direct use of currently available GCM-generated values of potential evaporation in the assessment of the effects of climatic change on continental hydrology and water resources. They also provide a partial explanation of the excessively low values of summer soil moisture in GCMs and raise questions concerning the results of studies of soil-moisture changes induced by an increase of greenhouse gases. Nevertheless, an approximate analytical result suggests that the basic dependence of changes in soil moisture on changes in the atmospheric state was qualitatively preserved in those studies.},

Two 2-year simulations, forced by the ISLSCP (1987–88) data sets, are conducted with and without irrigation. The analysis focuses on irrigation modeling validation and briefly presents first results on irrigation's impact on the surface fluxes.},
