\section{Chapter introduction}
This chapter presents results on the impacts of irrigation over several years of simulation, with a focus on annual and seasonal means. 


\section{Article: Regional study of the impacts of irrigation on the atmospheric and terrestrial water cycle using GCM-like physics}

\section{Study of the impacts of irrigation under climate change}
This section is based on the results of Mariame Maiga's internship for her 1st year of Masters at Sorbonne Université, which I co-supervised with Frédérique Cheruy from April to July 2025.
