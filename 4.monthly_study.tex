\section{Chapter introduction}

This chapter presents results of coupled regional climate simulations run with ICOLMDZ and ORCHIDEE to study the impacts of irrigation on land-atmosphere coupling variables and the water cycle over several years of simulation, with a focus on annual and seasonal means. The main objective was to address the following questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Is simulated irrigation realistic in coupled simulations ? What are its limits and perspectives for improvements ?
    \item What impacts does simulated irrigation have on the water cycle and land-atmosphere interactions ? Does irrigation improve the ability of the model to represent them ?
    \item At the scale of the Iberian Peninsula, is the impact of irrigation limited to intensely irrigated areas or can remote effects be observed as a consequence of atmospheric feedbacks ?
    \item How are the impacts of irrigation modulated in a future climate, under a strong climate change scenario ?
\end{itemize}

In the process of identifying the adequate simulation setup for the LAM, considering how recent the model is, particular attention was paid to the consistency of the model. Structural biases were identified in the transition zone one the edges of the LAM, with possible associated impacts in the free zone. A sensitivity analysis on the size of the domain enabled pursuing the work with a limited influence of these biases but several secondary questions were identified as to their source and other ways to reduce them. These were further investigated during Mariame Maiga's'internship for her first year of Masters at Sorbonne Université, which I co-supervised with Frédérique Cheruy from April to July 2025. 
All these analyses provided valuable understanding of the sensitivities of the LAM to its lateral forcing and addressed the following questions: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Which variables have an inconsistent behaviour in the transition zone ? How can these inconsistencies be explained ?
    \item How can the size of the domain limit the extent of these inconsistencies to ensure the LAM is not influenced in the free zone ?
    \item How dependent on the choice of lateral forcing are the inconsistencies in the transition zone ? 
    \item How much does the sampling frequency of the forcing file influence the consistency and performance of the LAM ?
\end{itemize}

This chapter first contains methodological aspects regarding the simulation setups used and the reference products used for evaluation of the LAM. 
In Section \ref{sec:forcing_influence}, the inconsistencies in the transition zone are analysed in simulations without irrigation, focusing on the impact of the domain size, and the characteristics of the forcing file.

Section \ref{sec:article1} then presents the impacts of irrigation on land-atmosphere interactions and the water cycle, under the present climate of the Iberian Peninsula. These results were included in an article currently under review in Earth System Dynamics: \url{https://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2025/egusphere-2025-2491/}.
The article was not included as a whole in the thesis manuscript (%todo:internal link to Appendix, adapt sentence
), but many elements were reused and adapted, to avoid redundancies with Chapters \ref{chap:introduction} and \ref{chap:methods} and enable a better integration with additional results from Sections \ref{sec:forcing_influence} and \ref{sec:climate_change}, and Chapter \ref{chap:liaise}.
Finally, Section \ref{sec:climate_change} contains results obtained from coupled simulations of future climate under a strong climate change scenario, highlighting the impacts of climate change over the Iberian Peninsula, and how they interact with irrigation.

\section{Chapter-specific methods}
\subsection{Coupled simulations}
All the results presented in this chapter derived from coupled simulation run with ICOLMDZ and ORCHIDEE using the LAM described in Chapter \ref{chap:methods}. The routing and irrigation schemes were used with the parameter set identified after the offline calibration presented in Chapter \ref{chap:routing}, and the MERIT DEM at 2-km resolution.

Several simulation setups and periods were used to produce the result presented here but they all used a hexagonal domain centered at (40.4°N, -3.7°E), with a radius ($R_{domain}$) of either 1000km, 1500km or 2000km. When changing the radius of the domain, the $NBP$ parameter (number of grid cells on the domain radius) was adapted to either 40, 60, or 80, to ensure that grid cells kept the same diameter of 25km. The setup with a $R_{domain}=1500 km$ and $NBP=60$ is presented in Fig. \ref{fig:domain_full_hex}. 
 
Since the spatial resolution was always the same, the timesteps were also fixed, to 30s for the dynamical core, and 15mn for the atmospheric physics and the LSM (including routing and irrigation).
The forcing file is interpolated temporally so that lateral conditions can be read at every time step of the dynamics.
Forcing files from two different sources were used, and the differences this choice can induce are analysed in Section \ref{sec:forcing_influence}. In Section \ref{sec:article1}, the forcing variables are extracted from the ERA5 reanalysis, while for future climate simulations, in Section \ref{sec:climate_change}, outputs from a global ICOLMDZOR simulation under greenhouse gases emission scenario SSP5 8.5 were used as forcing variables.
Sensitivity tests on the impact of the forcing file sampling frequency are also presented in Section \ref{sec:forcing_influence}, with forcing files containing either hourly or 6-hourly data.
This sensitivity was of interest since future climate simulations were initially supposed to use CMIP6 output variables, which are available only every six hours. However, this option was eventually discarded due to technical difficulties such as unexpected model crashes when running simulations with this sampling frequency and issues with the formatting of the forcing file from CMIP6 outputs. The future climate simulations presented here were therefore run using hourly outputs from a global ICOLMDZOR simulation.

\end{figure}

The main study period under current climate is from 2010 to 2022, since before and after that period not all forcing variables were readily available on the IPSL servers and running the LAM would have required substantial manual data collection work. Some sensitivity analysis of Section \ref{sec:forcing_influence} were run on specific or shorter periods to overcome technical issues or to limit the computing time and ressources used.
All simulations were run after a 3-year spinup period to make sure that vegetation and hydrological variables had reached an equilibrium. 
To analyse the impact of domain size, simulations were only run between 2010 and 2014. 
For the analysis of the forcing file sampling frequency, simulations were only run over the year 2013 because of unexpected model crashes in other simulation years. This same year was run 10 times in chained simulations (starting each new simulation year at the end of the previous one) that can act as a small ensemble, although it must be noted that this secific year cannot represent the diversity of current climate by itself.
%todo: add period for future climate (2050-2062 ? longer ?)

As a technical reminder, although the outputs of the model are natively on a hexagonal grid, in this chapter they are interpolated to a more traditional longitude-latitude grid of similar resolution, to simplify posttreatment and comparisons to evaluation products.

Considering the focus on land-atmosphere coupling, the analysis is often restricted to the Iberian Peninsula, thus excluding ocean grid cells and the land grid cells north of the Pyrenees, which flow to France. To prevent mismatches between the simulations and the evaluation datasets because of different coastlines, the analysis is further reduced to grid cells where the continental fraction is greater than 95\%.

\end{table*}

The simulations in present climate conditions were evaluated against the monthly mean values of several reference gridded products listed in Table \ref{tab:obs-datasets}.
The ERA5 reanalysis \citep{hersbach_era5_2020} at 0.25° resolution was first used as a reference product to asses the realism of multiple variables (precipitation, ET, 2-m temperature), and this is how the inconsistencies studied in Section \ref{sec:forcing_influence} were identified. However, as in most simulations ERA5 was the source used for the lateral boundary conditions which does not make it the most appropriate reference product for evaluation. Therefore, and also considering the fact that data assimilation for this reanalysis is not used for all variables, other reference products were used for precipitation and evapotranspiration.

Precipitation data from the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) Full Data Monthly Product Version 2020 \citep{gpcc_v2020} was used. This product provides precipitation data until 2019 over land on a 0.25° x 0.25° grid using in situ rain gauges. 

For ET, the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) dataset was used, in its fourth version \citep{miralles_gleam4_2025}. This product computes ET using a large set of input variables obtained from reanalyses as well as in situ and satellite observations. Monthly values at 0.25° resolution were used, initially given in mm month$^{-1}$ but converted to mm d$^{-1}$. GLEAM4 is available until 2022 but when precipitation and ET were evaluated jointly (Sections \ref{sec:forcing_influence}, \ref{sec:article1}), it was only used over the availability period of GPCC data (2010-2019).

Simulated irrigation was evaluated in the Ebro Valley region using a high resolution remote sensing product from the European Space Agency (ESA) Irrigation+ project \citep{dari_regional_2023}. This product estimates irrigation with a soil moisture based approach using satellite measurements from Sentinel-1, and provides data for three intensely irrigated areas: the Ebro Basin in Spain, the Po Valley in Italy and the Murray-Darling Basin in Australia. From 2016 to 2020 in the Ebro Basin, the median values of the RMSE, Pearson correlation coefficient $r$ and bias are 12.4 mm over 14 days, 0.66, and -4.62 mm over 14 days, respectively. Weekly values are aggregated to a monthly average in mm d$^{-1}$.

The simulated river discharge was evaluated against monthly observation data from discharge stations of the Global Runoff Data Center \citep[GRDC, https://grdc.bafg.de,][]{fekete_global_2003}.
Stations were positioned on the MERIT DEM grid with tools presented in \cite{polcher_hydrological_2023}, which use the GPS position of the stations as well as the upstream catchment area to find the most appropriate grid cell for comparison with the observations. 
The 18 selected stations with available data over the simulation period and an adequate position on the DEM grid are described in Table \ref{table:stations_data} and shown in Fig. \ref{fig:selected_stations}. Most stations have available data from January 2010 to September 2017, and in Section \ref{sec:article1}, river discharge was therefore evaluated using the first eight years of simulation (2010-2017).

\section{Chapter conclusions}

This chapter presents results from coupled simulations with the ICOLMDZOR LAM to study the regional climate of the Iberian Peninsula, and the impacts irrigation has on this climate and the water cycle, through land-atmosphere interactions. 

To identify an appopriate simulation setup for the study, the sensitivities of the LAM to the size of the domain and the choice of lateral forcing (both its source and sampling frequency) were analysed. They revealed an inconsistent behaviour of the LAM in the transition zone when forced by ERA5 data, in particular unexpectedly low cloud cover and precipitation. These biases were attributed to discrepancies between the physics used to produce the ERA5 reanalysis and the physics of LMDZ, which kept the large-scale condensation scheme from forming clouds and precipitation properly.
These analyses also showed that this inconsistent behaviour in the transition zone could have impacts in the centre of the domain, and in particular over the Iberian Peninsula. Using large domains did not make these inconsistencies disappear but limited their influence over the Peninsula since the transition zone was futher away.
Simulations with forced with ICOLMDZOR outputs were compared to the initial setup with forcing data from ERA5 and showed large improvements in the consistency of the model in the transition zone. These findings confirmed that in the transition zone, the model was sensitive to the choice of the forcing data, and identified a possibly better forcing source for future studies with the LAM. However, in the central zone, the inherent biases of the ICOLMDZOR model were stronger, which limited the improvements in performance over the Iberian Peninsula, since winter precipitation was strongly overestimated in mountainous areas.

Sensitivity experiments to look into the impact of the forcing file sampling frequency were also conducted and showed that using 6-hourly ERA5 data for the lateral forcing instead of hourly data amplified the biases in the transition zone, and degraded performance in the rest of the domain for precipitation and ET. This analysis was conducted with the idea that 6-hourly forcing data could be used for future climate simulation but this option was eventually discarded for technical reasons and all simulations in the rest of this manuscript were run using hourly forcing data.

To study the impacts of irrigation on land surface-atmosphere coupling variables and the water cycle over the Iberian Peninsula, two simulations were run, with an without irrigation. They were conducted using ERA5 forcing data, which was the only option technically available at the time, with a larger domain size than initially envisionned (the intermediate domain size) to limit the impact of the transition zone discrepancies on the study area.

This study first showed that the ORCHIDEE irrigation scheme simulates realistic values from April to September in areas where surface water withdrawals are most important, such as the Ebro Valley. However, it cannot represent winter irrigation, or satisfy irrigation demand in southern regions, where actual irrigation is more dependent on groundwater pumping and river dams, due to low available volumes in rivers and groundwater routing reservoirs. Ongoing developments to add river dams into the ORCHIDEE routing scheme \citep{baratgin_modeling_2024} could very likely improve this aspect by representing interseasonal water storage, making more water available in summer.
Explicit dam representation could also limit the winter and spring overestimates of river discharge in anthropized areas, since water would be stored in the dam reservoirs during this season instead of flowing in the rivers. 
Overall, the irrigation parameterization reduces river discharge and enables better agreement with observations, but since it is only active when the LAI is above a defined threshold, these impacts are mostly visible in summer and autumn. Future work with a looser activation threshold for irrigation could help to represent winter crop irrigation, although it is not expected to have as significant an impact on discharge as an explicit dam representation since simulated irrigation demand would still remain low in winter. Nevertheless, precipitation biases are very likely to remain a major driver of discharge biases, largely independent of irrigation or dam representation.

The simulation of precipitation and ET over the Iberian Peninsula is satisfactory in winter and spring, but this study highlighted a large underestimation in summer and contrasted spatial patterns with positive precipitation biases in elevated regions and negative biases in plains. ET underestimation is partly improved by simulated irrigation, but remains present on average and over most of the domain. 
It was only a hypothesis at the time, but it is now clear that running simulations with ICOLMZOR output as forcing data would improve the underestimation of summer precipitation and ET, but also degrade the performance in winter river discharge due to excessive precipitation in moutainous areas.
% These linked biases might be improved with a different simulation setup, particularly in the lateral forcing. Preliminary analyses (not shown) revealed an abnormal behaviour of the model in the transition zone between the ERA5 forcing zone and the central free zone, which was attributed to discrepancies between the physics used in the model and in the reanalysis. This resulted in precipitation underestimations throughout the entire simulation domain, which were largely improved by using a larger domain for the simulations presented here. A good lead for future works would be to use lateral forcing from global simulations of the ICOLMDZOR model or nested LAM simulations rather than a reanalysis, but these options are not yet technically available.
To improve these biases would likely require more work in ICOLMDZOR, regarding the modelling of radiative processes, shallow and deep convection (whose tuning often focuses on tropical regions), or surface processes (roughness, albedo, components of ET). This highlighted the fact that the results of this study are necessarily limited by the modelling choices, uncertainties, and biases of the IPSL-CM, and therefore remain largely model-specific.

The atmospheric impacts of irrigation were analysed in detail in summer, since it is the season with the largest irrigation values and the most significant response for all variables of interest, although it is the driest season, with very little precipitation. 
In JJA, the strong response of turbulent fluxes to irrigation leads to cooling and moistening of the lower atmosphere and significantly affects its structure (LCL and ABL height), with stronger effects on intensely irrigated regions, which is consistent with the findings of \citet{rappin_landatmosphere_2022}. In contrast, significant increases in precipitation are mostly detected in lightly irrigated mountainous areas surrounding the highly irrigated Ebro Valley. This points to a dominant effect of ABL stabilization, described by \citet{findell_atmospheric_2003-1, ek_influence_2004}, in intensely irrigated areas, and remote effects of atmospheric moistening as in \citet{deangelis_evidence_2010, lo_irrigation_2013, yang_impact_2017}. 
An improved representation of winter and spring irrigation could either allow to generalize the following results or to identify different responses to irrigation under moister atmospheric conditions.
Furthermore, over the Iberian Peninsula, increases in ET are proportional to applied irrigation and actually exceed it for almost every simulation month. This is made possible by small but systematic increases in average precipitation over the domain, forming evidence of continental moisture recycling over the Iberian Peninsula. The precipitation increases are of lower magnitude than those of ET and occur much more in lightly irrigated regions than in intensely irrigated regions, confirming that the recycling is partial and mostly nonlocal.

These findings called for an analysis of surface-atmosphere coupling processes in the presence of irrigation at the diurnal scale to better describe the impacts on the ABL structure in both irrigated areas and neighbouring regions.
Therefore, the LAM was compared to field observations from the LIAISE campaign, held in the Ebro Valley in July 2021 \citep{boone_land_2025}, and to mesoscale simulations which had already been run over the campaign area and analysed in \citet{lunel_irrigation_2024,lunel_marinada_2024}. These results are presented in Chapter \ref{chap:liaise}.
%High resolution modelling experiments using irrigation parameterizations have shown large improvements of performance relative to LIAISE observations for turbulent fluxes, air temperature and humidity \citep{lunel_irrigation_2024, udina_irrigation_2024}; stressed the importance of the convection parameterization for the response of precipitation to irrigation \citep{udina_irrigation_2024}; and identified interactions of irrigation-induced heterogeneities with regional breeze circulations \citep{lunel_marinada_2024}. Conducting similar analyses with the simulation setup used in this study should provide insights into the ability of an ESM to reproduce the complex structure of these heterogeneities \citep{mangan_surface-boundary_2023} and their impacts on the ABL and atmospheric water cycle.
